        "I wish she could teach me some moves.",

        "Anderson Silva's gay brother seems to disagree though.", 
        "You show Todd some respect!", 
        "He is just crazy enough to go for it", 
        "Guaranteed he asks to see RDAs xray first. I wanna see it myself.", 
        "Hell he could have broken it on purpose. Everyone seems afraid of Connor. And for good reason. ", 
        "can you spell his name correctly\n\nEdit wow that in text seams real bitchy, put it does slightly annoy me.  Mac instead of Mc as well. do people not notice or am i to picky. \n\nEdit: My windows are all now broken. Still believe people should spell others name correctly. ", 
        "SEAMS!!!! LOL! You're the one who can't spell dude", 
        "Muprhys Law", 
        "Believe I did. But posted from my phone so autocorrect is like naah. ",

        "Touch\u00e9  \nA classic example of Muprhy's law. \nYes Muprhy's, not Murphy's.", 
        "Missing a great opportunity for CM Punk's debut", 
        "BAH GAWD, HE'S HERE! HE'S FINALLY HERE! ", 
        "*Look in my eyyyyeeeeeessss, what do you see?*", 
        "Nate mounts Conor and rains down strikes, Herb is about to call it. Conor can't take much more, but then out of nowhere Pendred the GOAT storms the cage with a steel chair.", 
        "Just as Mcgregor is about to grab the belt Frankie's music hits", 
        "\"What on Earth?\"\n\n\"This is brilliant!\"\n\n\"Frankie Edgar, Mr. Money in the Bank! What the hell, can he do this?\"\n\n\"He's cashing in! He's cashing in!\"",

        "I miss that fucker.", 
        "I want him back so bad :(", 
        "RDA telling it like it is. This fight makes no sense to anyone but the UFC brass", 
        "This fight makes no sense! (But everyone is going to watch it anyway... right guys?)", 
        "Has RDA ever specifically said \"I want to fight Conor.\"? Because it seems like he doesn't want Conor anywhere near the lightweight division. I mean when he got injured and Diaz was announced to replace him, RDA said that was a crappy match up. Not realizing that Diaz would finish Conor.", 
        "Fight makes no sense, but he ain't beating both of them on the same night.", 
        "It makes sense to both fighters and the UFC on a financial standpoint, but it is a huge risk.  If Conor loses again, I would have a hard time imagining him recovering from that.", 
        "I mean from a matchmakers standpoint it makes zero sense, Conor got murked by a guy who was drinking Mai Tais in Mexico 12 days before the fight. Nate will take the fight for another fat paycheck, and Conor's ego won't let him take the L and move on. ", 
        "Oh, trust me I would rather see him against Frankie.  But it is the \"smart\" move when it comes to financials, atleast in the short term.  If Conor loses, it's a long term problem.", 
        "If a rematch happens. Diaz and McGregor 3 should just be a good cop bad cop movie. Because that would make just as much sense ", 
        "I'd watch that. Who's directing and what's the plot? ", 
        "[UFC response to the criticisms](http://replygif.net/i/718.gif)", 
        "And the 1.5+ million people who will order it ", 
        "I'll order it just to see Diaz defend his title", 
        "King of the 145ers.", 
        "No one will ever care about the other belts, as long as the owner of the McGregor belt is other than McGregor!", 
        "They will keep rematching while GSP keeps attending until Mcgregor gets the victory and calls him out", 
        "GSP would fucking ruin Conor without breaking a sweat.", 
        "Never even thought of that but this is the only thing that makes sense right now", 
        "But only if he's *impressed with his performance* ", 
        "The fact that he's the belt holder .... and has to call people out speaks volumes ...", 
        "He's also the guy who pulled out and is trying to get his big red pantie night", 
        "So sad. Have a drink for the real champ tonight boys!", 
        "Nate was right, he didn't give a fuck about a belt, now nobody gives a fuck about a belt. ", 
        "\"y u scare Misser Magragoo? theses guys..\"", 
        "How much would it suck for RDA if he misses out on the money fight against McGregor and has to fight Khabib on a Fight Night card. 10x harder and 10x less money. ", 
        "The LW king has spoken feed him Conor.", 
        "RDA pissed because his payday is long gone and will probably not happen at this point. ", 
        "that's what he gets for pussyfooting ", 
        "To be fair, his foot was broken as fuck.", 
        "Probably shouldn't be kicking steel poles 2 weeks before a big fight", 
        "he is probably right", 
        "The more I thought about it, the more I came to the conclusion he is right. ... Not even joking or trolling.", 
        "true rda won against diaz easily", 
        "As opposed to fake RDA?", 
        "You can't compared at all... Nate didn't even make weight that fight. Obviously wasn't his best", 
        "Well, I think he'd beat Diaz again, but it'd probably go the distance like last time. Not sure if his body could hold up against Conor after that, though. We'll never know...\n\nBook it, Dana. RDA vs. Diaz/McGregor, UFC 200.", 
        "make it a triple threat match!", 
        "I'd prefer a handicap match. Nate Stockton slaps with the right, Conor hammering away with those powerful lefts. If RDA takes Conor down, Diaz just steps back and pisses himself laughing as Conor gets molested.", 
        "I don't get why they haven't booked RDA v McGregor again. The whole point of this exercise was Conor making history and holding two belts. If we're throwing the rulebook out of the window and booking fights based on novelty, why revisit Nate?", 
        "because Nate won", 
        "The whole thing fucked, the reason RDA Vs Conor isn't a thing is because Nate beat Conor and now Nate Vs RDA makes more sense. However, if they're just going to rematch Nate and Conor, then they might aswell rescheduled RDA Vs Conor, i don't fucking know anymore i'm done.\n", 
        "so you want Conor to get a title shot at a higher weight class while coming off a loss?", 
        "I don't want either, but out of the 2 the original bout makes more sense to me.", 
        ">  booking fights based on novelty, \n\nit was about most views and a payday.\n\nRDA was a big payday for everyone, Nate was one too that fans wanted and and I think Conor expected that he would win easily and it would help the hype machine. ", 
        "They are probably tired of trying to make these super fights and people backing out. (Aldo and RDA)\n\nFuck it, they dont want to fight, let Conor fight whoever. Everyone in the MMA scene just wants to see Conor fight everyone right now. Not going to happen. If you want to sell a BIG fight, let Conor overcome adversity. ", 
        "I never thought I would be so bummed about the main event of 200. Lawler/Woodely or Nate or Condit 2 (i'm happy), RDA/Nate (I'm happy), Meisha/Rousey 3 (i'm happy), Conor/Edgar (I'm super happy). But Nate/Conor 2, wtf is this shit? \n\nI think I'm ready to accept that UFC 200 is just another card and it won't be anything special.", 
        "It makes cents RDA, millions and millions and millions of cents", 
        "Move the needle, RDA.  This is the \"sports entertainment\" business now.  Re-brand yourself as \"The Brazilian Blur\" and start shit at weigh-ins and press conferences.\n\n", 
        "We gon be championship?", 
        "RDA vs Khabib/Ferguson winner at 200 is my bet ... ", 
        "this sub would make a terrible promoter.  this fight blew up the internet and did the most buys ever and was entertaining.  no shit they are not gonna go off what makes sense to the hardcore fans.  ", 
        "Make it happen", 
        "In other words, \"Pick me! Pick me!\"", 
        "i have a feeling mcgregor and dos anjos will meet sometime down the road. Frankie deserves his time over anyone else right now", 
        "RDA vs Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz for the co-main and main event for UFC 200 has been confirmed!", 
        "So? It's not a title shot, you're the highest up guy, it's not like Conor or Nate are the title holder, the reason theese guys are fighting is not to detirmine who is the best in the division.", 
        "He probably would", 
        "Now that is a fight that interests me", 
        "this is some funny trash talk lol", 
        "It makes some sense later but the hype needs to be rebuilt. \n\nStyle wise Nate was one of the worst picks IMO. \nLonger reach was key, Conor really relies on his reach and timing/power to connect first or last as he moves in and out of range.  Nate had a longer reach and the result was a lot of timing issues. I would still be interested in an RDA fight because all those close calls against nate would have connected against RDA.\nThe lefty thing is also a factor since Nate had zero problem with that area. \n\nI think RDA wins on the ground but its not the same fight stylistically.", 
        "It does make no sense. Why are we rematching a straightforward non-title fight?", 
        "Like what is said with all these Bellator freak fights: \"u would watch it tho\". That's all people care about.", 
        "Finally , someone besides us, with our superior intellectual intelligence over here on r/mma speaks the truth.", 
        "He probably would and all lol!", 
        "I just want to see Khabib . Thats all.", 
        "This is a pretty big risk they're taking just to try and get Conor to save face.", 
        "RDA fucked his chance at fighting CM up now he's mad", 
        "Punk would get murdered bro.",

        "Pains me to say it but his statement is plausible to me lol", 
        "And that's why it makes sense. Dudes need to realize UFC is not a tournament but an entertainment business.", 
        "Yeah I can't see McGregor being able to withstand the RDA war machine. ", 
        "More like he'd pull out of the fight the day before.", 
        "As much as i hate to say it. He isnt wrong", 
        "Although I agree the fight makes no sense, RDA's attempts at getting the UFC to give him another money fight forafter pulling out are kinda pathetic.", 
        "Why?", 
        "Yeah, pathetic because he would not fight with a broken foot. If Conor had that injury he would've pulled out too.", 
        "It's not a matter of being right to pull out or not, he jeopardized an entire card 10 days before it went live because he did not train safely. He's free to train the way he wants, but he shouldn't be throwing shots at 2 guys that did save that ppv because he was having intensive sessions so close to the fight. Since nate won, now Nate's a good draw and he wants the fight with him, otherwise he wouldn't give 2 shits about it. He should stay a bit humble and accept whatever the ufc offers him and not comment on what the ufc might do with 2 fighters that probably aren't even going to fight him for that belt.", 
        "Make perfect sense and no he wouldn't. ", 
        "He would."
