At no point in this fight did he have the upper hand. He was landing flush and not backing Diaz up at all. You could say he was up on points after the first round but everyone knew he was in big trouble.  Also where did you get this theory that he had his hands low because he underestimated the power of welterweights? Far more likely is that is just his style and wont change regardless the weight he fights at.
The story of the night is Conor lost to an average 170er in Nate Diaz, who didn't train for the fight, and who has been nothing more than a stepping stone for the last five years. And it's not like Diaz is naturally bigger than Conor, they both walk around at 170. Fact is Conor was exposed in this fight. There are serious doubts if he can even beat clay guida.
