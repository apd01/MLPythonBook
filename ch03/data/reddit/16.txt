Is that seriously your response to that? I point out Diaz has had a middling career in the UFC and you come back with 'there's like 7 billion people on the planet'. My god, fanboys are pathetic people, regardless of which fighter from last night you're suckling on. Diaz has never been a threat to any champion. He's a good boxer, an entertaining fighter, but he's lost nearly half his fights in the UFC for a reason.
