Completely different fighters though.

Diaz did a lot of things really well that made it very difficult for Conor to be Conor. Against RDA he has his reach advantage back, RDA is more susceptible to body work than Diaz is, and I don't think RDA could survive that sort of punishment if Conor hit him that much.

Fights simply don't translate like that. I mean you just have to look at the women's bantamweights.

For what it is worth I would likely pick RDA by submission. But I think Conor would beat Cerrone for example.
