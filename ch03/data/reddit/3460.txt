jesus christ get off his nuts.  So many ufc super stars run off after losing?  Vitor has never run off, dan henderson has never run off, chuck liddel, gsp, matt hughes, rich franklin all stayed to do interviews.  Conor wasnt exactly humble as he kept making excuses saying nate was more efficient with his energy.  AKA, Nate beat my ass and I have no excuse because I gassed so I'm going to say he was more efficient with his energy.
