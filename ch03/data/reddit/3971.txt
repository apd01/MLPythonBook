Remember when people on r/mma thought Conor could take RDA and Robbie?

I got downvoted into oblivion on an alt account for saying I wanted to see Nate vs. Conor and Nick vs. Robbie. Their records and losses are against all amazing fighters with some great fights to decision and some terrible robberies. Nick and Nate are the real deal. STOCKTON!
