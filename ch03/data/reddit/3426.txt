Conor had a nice first round -- put together a few nice combos, was staying away from Nate's jab and had Nate cut. But that grew into overconfidence and although Nate was bleeding he was never really hurt (I'm pretty sure Rogan said the Diaz brothers have a ton of scar tissue and they bleed easily)

I think Conor's overconfidence led to him trying to prove that he had some sort of iron chin in the second round but for Christ sake's man it doesn't matter who you are after you take 3-4 clean shots right on the chin you need to start putting your hands up. His head stopped moving, Nate connected, and the rest was a mixture of being rocked, getting panicked, and getting absolutely outclassed on the ground by a BJJ black belt.

Hats off to Nate that was an awesome fight. Short notice or not he proved Conor has no chance against the big boys. I hope Conor still gets to fight dos Anjos though. I think 155 is his true weight class.
