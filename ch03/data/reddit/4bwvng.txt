His biggest problem was that he totally under estimated Nate, he thought Nate could never knock him out, and Nate very rarely goes for takedowns even though he is amazing on the ground.

I know his coach always says they don't train for a specific fighter, but we all know thats rubbish.)\n\nA full camp Mendes is a very dangerous fight for any 145er past or present.
