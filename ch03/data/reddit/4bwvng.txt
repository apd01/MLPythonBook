I know his coach always says they don&#39;t train for a specific fighter, but we all know thats rubbish.)</p>\n\n<p>A full camp Mendes is a very dangerous fight for any 145er past or present. But that ko against Frankie should not have knocked him out but it do, it do. </p>\n\n<p>To think that McGregor would be destroyed by Mendes is a bit much, he could be dominated, taken down and busted up. But there is just as much of a chance that he would catch Mendes on the chin with a left and it could be all over, it could be Aldo all over again. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; McGregor is still a champion who beat Jose Aldo, don&#39;t sleep on him it&#39;s very foolish. </p>\n</div>",
