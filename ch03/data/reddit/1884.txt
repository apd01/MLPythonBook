I mean we can agree to disagree but I feel that he shouldn't have taken it easy as he did, when you tag nate a couple times he should have just turned on the aggression and go in with more shots.  He'd get a couple in, take a step back and just have his hands down, then he does a big right swing which misses and it goes downhill from there.  Not to mention he almost seemed kinda gassed prior to getting tagged by that 1-2.
