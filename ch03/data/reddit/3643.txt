Coming out of round one I thought there was no way Diaz could make it out of round two. He was taking bomb after bomb and just went nuts on Conor for the entire second round. Amazing, gutsy performance, and the defeat has so far been accepted with grace by Conor. I think both men looked like worthy champions in their own ways
