The cabo thing came out after the bout. Diaz and his coaches have stated that they told the UFC that they were training for a triathlon. Conor had no idea what shape Nate was in and was led to believe that he was in good shape - he didn't look for an out of shape fighter, he thought he was facing an in shape fighter. \n\n* Before calling Nate, Conor went for Edgar who has been very vocal about always being ready and not in danger of gassing and Aldo who publicly stated that he would fight McGregor anytime/anywhere and was training just in case someone pulled out. They were Conor's first two picks which were based on comments from and Jos\u00e9 and Frankie themselves. \n\n* lastly at 189 Conor pushed for the Nate fight as a higher weight because he wanted to put on a a show and \"the Diaz bros always come to fight\" \n\nConor is many things, but someone who hand picks opponents for less if a challenge isn't one of them. Conor could have easily insisted on 155, Nate's leverage was hypothetical as he would not walk away from that opportunity for anything -  conor gave him the 170 because he felt without it's he would not put up much of a fight (he was wrong, but that doesn't make him a cherry picker) ", 
    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Conor handpicked lightweight fighter Nate Diaz (apparently Nate was also first choice as replacement after Aldo fell through at 189) on 11 days notice and because Nate was not in his usual fight condition, i.e. carrying more bodyfat than usual and not sparring. Since Nate was not only out of camp but on vacation, the fight was set above the 155 limit</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot here you need to stand over:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Firstly, who should have they gone with and at what weight? </p></li>\n<li><p>Secondly, White and Diaz are on record stating that they were physically ready for the fight before the bout. The cabo thing came out after the bout. Diaz and his coaches have stated that they told the UFC that they were training for a triathlon. Conor had no idea what shape Nate was in and was led to believe that he was in good shape - he didn&#39;t look for an out of shape fighter, he thought he was facing an in shape fighter. </p></li>\n<li><p>Before calling Nate, Conor went for Edgar who has been very vocal about always being ready and not in danger of gassing and Aldo who publicly stated that he would fight McGregor anytime/anywhere and was training just in case someone pulled out. They were Conor&#39;s first two picks which were based on comments from and Jos\u00e9 and Frankie themselves. </p></li>\n<li><p>lastly at 189 Conor pushed for the Nate fight as a higher weight because he wanted to put on a a show and &quot;the Diaz bros always come to fight&quot; </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conor is many things, but someone who hand picks opponents for less if a challenge isn&#39;t one of them. Conor could have easily insisted on 155, Nate&#39;s leverage was hypothetical as he would not walk away from that opportunity for anything -  conor gave him the 170 because he felt without it&#39;s he would not put up much of a fight (he was wrong, but that doesn&#39;t make him a cherry picker) </p>\n</div>",
