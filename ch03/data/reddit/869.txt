Eating two breakfasts a day trying to get to 170 killed his endurance. Diaz is definitely much superior at bjj and it showed. Let's be honest though, Conor had to put on weight to get to the 170 lb mark and still came in under. Diaz walks around over 170. Diaz definitely outclassed Conor in this fight with or without the excuses. But packing on 20lbs in a few months and trying to fight and not lose endurance is impossible.
