For me this is like if the Undertaker had of lost his WrestleMania streak in a dark match. I get why you guys are stoked for Diaz, but what's next for him? I feel like nothing was accomplished with that fight. Diaz isn't walking out with a title, the only thing this fight did was lose Conor's mystique. I feel like this is bad for UFC.
