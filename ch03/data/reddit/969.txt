Oh damn. I forgot about that whole angle that they have been working. This fight made it obvious (seems obvious to me, but maybe I'm wrong) that McGregor isn't going to be able to handle head shots from the higher weight classes. 

They REALLY needed him to win at least his first fight at the higher weight. That would have given them three fights to sell the "I'm coming for all your belts" storyline. Diaz really f'd up that route...we'll see though.
