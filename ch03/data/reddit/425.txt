I wouldn't call it a great win.  It was a decisive win, yes, but it came in a way that still has a lot of people wondering.   It's like if you're really good at a video game and then you give the controller to your little brother and he one-shots you.  Does that mean he's better at the game than you are?  Not a perfect analogy, but many people aren't sure how that fight would've gone if it got past the opening exchange.
