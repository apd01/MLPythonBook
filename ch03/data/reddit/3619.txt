Conor learned why weight classes exist. Nate walks around  180-185, conor bulking up with no cut weighed 168. Props to both of them, Diaz for fighting short notice and conor fighting 15 lbs higher than he planned too. Those shots Conor was landing would have sent anyone at 145 to the mat, but that power simply doesn't translate to guys who walk around at 180+.
