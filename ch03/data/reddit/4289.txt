Doesn't have to be to the head.  A thin torso'd opponent and body kicks can really wear them down.  

As for the takedowns, it can increase risk of it, but the Diaz brothers have next to no offensive wrestling.  If I was Conor that would have been the least of my fears.  Especially when you are talking about your biggest tool to negate the range advantage of Diaz.
