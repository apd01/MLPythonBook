Yeah. He was the champ of two weight divisions in Ireland before he signed to the UFC, then he ran through the UFC's featherweight division and beat the champ there, Jose Aldo, who was ranking pound for pound #1 in the world, and undefeated for like 10 years. And he beat him in like 30 seconds.

He's a great, exciting fighter. It's just that no one is unbeatable. I feel like it's hard to be undefeated in any combat sport, but MMA specifically because the fight can take place on the feet and on the ground.

Love this sport.
