Nate is a 155er anyway.   He just didn't cut weight.  Nate's fought at 170 before and did well until he started running up against great grapplers that could totally overpower him and had great sub defense.   Connor's even smaller than Nate and doesn't have a quarter of his ground skills.  He has no business at 170, ever.  He's gonna get overpowered by top grapplers at 155 too.  I think he's gonna have problems with Frankie Edgar at his own weight class. 

Connor is a good fighter.  He is not the Irish reincarnation of Bruce Lee.  There is no magic.  He is eminently beatable by any top tier fighter at his weight or above.  He is skilled and can win against top guys as well.   But this is the most overinflated hype train in the history of the sport.  It had to pop. 

I asked around this week looking for a bookie to place a bet on Diaz. Unfortunately I didn't find one in time.  I'm not much of a gambler.  But when I saw Nate at +380, it would be stupid not to jump on that.  The fans had created the equivalent of anoverinflated market bubble.  When I first got into mma 10 years ago, I used to see odds all the time that I knew were way off.  Unfortunately back then I didn't have the income to bet.  By the time I had a good enough income to do some betting, the bookmakers and fans had a better handle on the sport and I didn't really see odds that were out of bounds anymore.   Then came Connor McGregor.  When I saw Nate as nearly a 4 to 1 underdog my eyes popped.  I thought even with the big Connor following, Nate should have opened as only a slight underdog and even then only because Connor fans are crazy. 

I hope the fans write this loss off as being because it was at 170 and keep skewing the betting lines.   I look forward to making money off suckers.
