I really hope not. It takes balls to go from 145 -> 170 and take anyone on short notice. It is a whole different ball game at that weight and Conor just jumped in head first. He took the loss in the best fashion he could. 

If people don't know he trash talks to sell fights, they are just naive.    Although I do think Conor was a bit to cocky during the fight. Just keep you hands up man!
