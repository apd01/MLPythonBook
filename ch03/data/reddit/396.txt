Also, let the record show that Conor and Nate were almost exactly the same weight walking into the octagon. They did not cut weight for weigh ins. I see a lot of people excusing Conor for biting off more than he could chew in a heavier weight class against a bigger guy. Longer and taller, yes, but Nate had no size advantage in terms of weight. What we saw was Conor fighting someone his own size for once.
