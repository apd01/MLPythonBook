That's the whole point. Her image was a "once EVER" fighter as Joe Rogan so stupidly put it. She went and beat Bethe in Brazil. And everyone said "she can do anything" so she got wrapped up in the hype. And she actually believed she could beat Holly at standing. That's 100% ego. Pure vanity. 

Of course she's a competitor, she wouldn't have made it to the olympics/became the champion of the world if she wasn't a competition. But she wasn't obsessed with it. When people obsessed with winning lose they work their ASSES OFF to win again.  

She went and cried on Ellen and tried to kill herself.
