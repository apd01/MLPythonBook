Seems like the more media and promotion a fighter handles definitely has a detrimental effect. A video game cover might just generally signify that athlete as "the face of its sport at the moment" and thus that guy will probably have more media obligations than anyone. 

Conor was involved in documentaries, TUF, thousands of interviews, world tour, he was talking about movie deals, etc. It's just too much. Meanwhile Nate was home in Stockton grinding and improving with Nick and the rest of his team. 

Aside from that, Diaz looked a lot bigger and longer. Heavy on top once it went to the ground. I think McGregor is outmatched at 170. 155 might be his optimal weight class.
