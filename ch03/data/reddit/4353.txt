I'm a huge Conor fan but i think i'm at peace with this. Conor fought too cocky and we finally saw him buckle after he was rocked. Fighting with his hands down might work against shorter opponents, but it was a gift to Diaz. 

Happy Conor didn't get KOd. This won't keep him out of the octagon long. Congrats to Diaz.
