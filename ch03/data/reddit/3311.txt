I think Conor also gassed prior to getting tagged. He went from mixing it up with kicks and punches to standing and trading which in my opinion made him more predictable and If he didn't knock Diaz out, obviously it was only a matter of time before Diaz ran Conors tank dry and rang his bell. I didn't expect Conor to slow so soon.
