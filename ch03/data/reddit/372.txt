There's a video of cuss d'amato talking about the real way to do damage, which he says is light and fast volume. Paraphrasing but he says that a man can take a big shot but not 6 small shots. That's how the Diaz bros hit. Quick light volume punching that's incredibly accurate. No one can take that style.
