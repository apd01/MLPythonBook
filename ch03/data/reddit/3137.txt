Silly, silly McGregor. He had an exceptional first round, keeping Diaz at bay, and exploiting all his weaknesses. But then he got rocked in the second, and did exactly what Diaz always wants from his opponents; shoot for the take-down. I believe it was the "Inside The Octagon" breakdown where it was discussed how Diaz is not great at take-downs, and likes to rile up his opponents so they put themselves in a compromising position, thinking that moving to wrestling is the only way forward. Shitty decision by McGregor that Diaz capitalized on expertly.
