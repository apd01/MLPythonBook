That was an awesome fight. Conor has ZERO ground game. Both dude at bombs that would put the normal man to sleep. 

Questions though, does this change anything for either guy going into their next fights? Conor still has the belt at 145 and could fight at 155 for the title. Does Diaz get a shot at the 170lb title? He got dismantled at his last 155 title fight. This will be interesting to see how it plays out.
