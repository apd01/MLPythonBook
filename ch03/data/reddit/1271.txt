> And that height difference was monumental.

*Conor is 5'9". in the UFC he's finished Aldo (5'7"), Mendes (5'6"), Siver (5'7"), Poirier (5'9"), Brandao (5'7"), and Brimage (5'4").*

*his only decision was to Holloway (5'11"). his last loss was to Duffy (5'10"). now he fights Nate Diaz (6'0")*

maybe it was coincidence that Conor "struggled" with taller guys, maybe it wasn't, maybe he needed that height and reach over smaller guys to look more dominant than he was. 

we still dont really know tbh, but this is what happens when you make a god out of someone with 7 UFC fights.
