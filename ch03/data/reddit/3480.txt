Two weeks notice, I am not discrediting Diaz at all. I know most real mma fans know Conor has a weak ground game and would most likely get tapped from a choke seeing as that's Diaz go to and it's how Conor had lost his only 2 fights. Conor doesn't walk around at 170 at most he is walking around at 160-165. Time stamp of him saying he cut is at 32:50.
