Conor has always been very hittable despite his reach. There was actually a post earlier today(I think Cruz breaking down the fight?) where McGregor relying on his chin too much was mentioned. I think he did that this fight. He was confident that he could evade most shots and take those he couldn't.

He always talks about his opponents not respecting his power but, IMO, he has always done the same. I appreciate him trying to put on entertaining fights but in the future I see him being more patient and advancing less.
