That's standard in fighting in my experience, Just a defense mechanism to try and convince the guy not to jump on you or show him you're still there, I would guess. It's just a subconscious reaction for some people when they get hurt, Can't count how many times this happens in fights especially boxing. Nothing unique to Conor.
