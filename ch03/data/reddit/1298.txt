Yeah, nailed it here. It's exhausting to whiff punches and despite being the smaller guy Conor made no real adjustment from how he fights FWs and whiffed a ton more than usual.

As soon as the left landed for Nate in the 2nd it was clear Conor would need way more than a few seconds to fight like he's fresh again
