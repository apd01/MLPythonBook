I just started getting into it. I've never been into any sports but after hearing Joe Rogan's podcasts it has helped me deeply appreciate every aspect about martial arts. 

After hearing all the hype around Connor Mcgregor and the lack of support on the internet for Nate, I thought Nate Diaz didn't stand a chance because maybe he wasn't skilled enough, though I did want Nate to beat that cocky motherfucker. When Connor started getting dizzy, my heart started racing. When he tapped out, i went ballistic. Never in my life have I ever screamed for any team or athlete. What a great fucking fight and what a great sport.
