I feel like no matter what people say, Connor is a greater figher than Nate. This fight was lost because Connor was fucking around too much with his guard down. 


Props to Nate for winning but if Connor is half as smart as he likes to show, he will learn a lot from this fight and hopefully become a more humble and straight up better fighter.
