Then after Carwin beat him he said he had all this extra strength but wasn't used to it, so it didn't do him any good in fights so decided to drop weight again... Then bulked up again...

Mir would drop or gain 20 lbs in between fights based on whatever new fad he felt he wanted to go in.  \n\nAt this point though I don't believe that belly is going anywhere anytime soon, think it's time he hung up the gloves.
