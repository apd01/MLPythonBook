The Diaz brothers are fan favorites, especially among hardcore fans.  There is no front, no act, no filter with them.  What you see is what you get, in all of its glorious insanity.  Some people love them.   Some people can't stand them.  But regardless of what anyone thinks about them personally, it's impossible not to respect them as fighters.  They aren't the best in the world, but they are consistently around the top 5, and a tough out even for the few that can beat them. 

They have a fight style that is very unique to the 2 of them.  Constant little jabs and pitter patter shots that seem slow as molasses, but yet they keep landing.  Many opponents have fallen in the trap.  Opponents basically ignore the shots that are landing on them because they don't hurt that bad and they keep thinking they'll land a countershot ko.  But they can never seem to land the counter clean and the multitude of light punches starts accumulating damage on their face.   They start to get disoriented and can't even get their counter shots off anymore.   Then the Diaz bros start mixing in harder punches.  No haymakers, but every 4th or 5th punch has some crack to it all of a sudden.  Then you either shoot a desperation takedown and get submitted, or you get totally swarmed with punches until you are a bloody heap on the mat. 

To beat the the Diaz brothers, you usually have to be an amazing wrestler with great positional control and submission defense.  You basically have to be strong enough to overpower them.  They are great on the feet.  Great on the ground.  But they just don't have the physical build to be good wrestlers.   The only other path to victory, is to be a great striker with excellent footwork that maintains distance and outpoints them or lands a gigantic shot to knock them out.  Very few have the combined skill and athletic ability to do either.
