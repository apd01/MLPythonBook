Really can't see him beating RDA now. This is like an awkward moment. He was so arrogant and he just seemed to wilt over in there. Obviously he was stunned but even the tap came very fast. He would have gone out anyway but I dunno... Didn't deal with adversity great. When he realised Nate could take his shots, you could see his demeanour change
