Spoken like someone who has never seen him fight. He wins a lot of fights in similar fashion, by waiting it out and using his reach to dismantle people when they gas. Literally just had to touch McGregor's chin once and we was done... McGregor threw a bunch of winging shots that hit nothing and landed a few good ones, but in the end Nate was the one who kept composed and proved he was the better fighter standing and on the ground.
