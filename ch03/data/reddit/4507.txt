OK - Connor lost. However, let's be honest - his movement, punching, even a good bit of clinching was solid. However, his cardio was way out of wack. We would initially expect excuses from his camp, right? But his interview with Rogan says otherwise - he gave Diaz credit, took it like a man (and still champion), but ceonceeded his lose. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not even a big Connor fan, but the fact that he was upfront with the loss says that next time he's going to be (likely) on point. Frankly, he can't afford to not be on point next time. Correct? The only reason it seems like I'm supporting him is because he works hard (but also, who doesn't?), started from the bottom, and had THE CONFIDENECE to move up weight. It's harder than he thought, true. DIAZ IS DEFINITELY A GREAT 'FIGHTER', but I believe (and again, I'm not a Connor fan) Connor is the superior athlete. I expect, given his experience, and his solid training (again, it looks like Diaz trained too, but in his usual weight class) that he will win some big fights in the future. Let's see what happens!
