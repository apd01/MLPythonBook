Meanwhile we have Dana White at every weigh-in standing in between the fighters to make sure we don't forget who runs the dog and pony show that is the UFC.   When they throw a cheap shot at a weigh in they aren't deducted points or lose part of their purse they instead get a pat on the back from the UFC marketing department.  \n\nThe UFC profits off the fact that people love mindless drama. The fights play second fiddle to the drama.  I think that's why we will never see Nate Diaz on Joe Rogan's podcast, he isn't willing to sell out to the hype. \n\n*spelling",
