I'm not getting you. 

Are you saying that Nate Diaz doesn't usually fight 155?  He does. 

Are you saying that Conor McGregor doesn't usually fight 145?  He does. 

Are you saying that fighting at 170 isn't going up two weight classes? It is. Unequivocally. 

Or are you saying that the match between  Conor and Nate wasn't a contest at 170? Because it was. Dana made a big deal that his poster boy was willing to take on a fight going up two weight classes. 

You aren't making sense.
