But i have trained at a half dozen gyms and I know that any decent trainer cares for it&#39;s fighters and makes sure that they get challenging but realistic match ups. The fight was obviously planed way in advance, this was not a brawl, there where rules, and both sides showed sportmanlike conduct before and after. Nothing indicates that this was a spontaneous event where neither side knew who they where fighting. Contrary, Robert is introduced as &quot;Kihon&quot;, meaning he probably trained karate. My guess would be kyokushin. Whereas Nate was introduced as Gracie. It was one of those stand up vs ground match ups, with a predictable outcome.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "Others have answered this for you but I'll throw my two cents in as well since you asked me - or replied to my comment, or whatever the reddit protocol is :)\n\nSo we load up the video and skip ahead to about 0:25, that's where the guillotine starts and so far so good for Mr. Limon.\n\nIf you pause at 0:28 there's a problem starting. Diaz knows what is happening and puts his left leg on the outside of Limon's right leg. Seems like a minor detail but it's a huge deal (we'll see why shortly).\n\nAt 0:30 Limon is falling back into a familiar position. He wants to pull back and really start to work the choke. Diaz is in an unfavourable position but he's very calm about it. The reason he's so calm is because a) he's likely used to this, and b) he has a *lot* of escape options available - many stemming from the simple fact that he got that left leg to the outside of Limon's right leg.\n\nAround 0:31 to 0:33 Limon is trying to adjust. What he *wants* to do is drop back and get his legs wrapped around Diaz's back - as though he was in closed guard. He wants to do this because it traps Diaz in a very bad spot and allows Limon to really work the guillotine. Limon attempts to get his legs around Diaz by trying to squeak his right leg out but Diaz steps high and blocks it at the knee - beautiful \"sense\" to be sure. He makes it look like effortless defense because he's further ahead than Limon, even though he's the one being threatened with a choke. That minor detail at 0:28 where Diaz got his leg to the outside of Limon's has now essentially nullified the choke.\n\n0:35 it's over. Diaz is in side control. Now, the crux of your question, why does this matter. The short answer is that it's nearly impossible to choke someone out in that position. You can squeeze until you're blue in the face but you're not going to constrict blood or air circulation from that angle. Diaz's trachea is protected by virtue of being on the opposite side of the angle of Limon's elbow and his carotid arteries can't both be pinched off from a squeeze originating behind the neck. Diaz can pretty much sit here until Limon squeezes his arm into exhaustion.\n\nMy post above jokingly reflects a common mistake of new BJJ practicioners as well as casual fight fans and tough-guy wannabes. People get a hold of a person's head and they think it's a trophy or treasure never to be relinquished. Unfortunately, in this case, it's a useless trophy. Yeah, he has Diaz's head but he lost position, is squeezing for no gain, will soon be mounted, and ultimately lose the fight.\n\nYou can see around 0:40 that Diaz is quite content to stay in side control while Limon squeezes his head and is effortlessly improving his position at virtually no cost. He's in no real danger of being submitted, Limon is tying up his own hands leaving Diaz free to position himself for a full mount.\n\nBetween 0:40 and 0:43 you see Limon recognize the danger here and he switches his hips to try to use his right leg to wrap Diaz's left leg and pull him back into a wonky half guard. Did you notice his mistake though? He's still holding on tight to that trophy head with his left so he can't properly defend side control. He's stuck in that \"I've gotta keep what I've got!\" mentality so badly that he's lost sight of the bigger picture.\n\n0:45 - 1:00 you can hear people telling Diaz to \"wait until he's (Limon) tired\" or \"wait until he's worn himself out\" something to that effect. It's true. It's hard to hold on and squeeze tight. You'll burn out your arms. From here Diaz pressures with knee-on-belly, Limon *finally* concedes the trophy but it's too late. He's tired, his position is awful, and Diaz mounts effortlessly for the finish. It's also worth mentioning that Limon's efforts to escape mount are woefully amateurish - he pretty much does everything wrong. Diaz is the *far* superior grappler here.\n\nIt's really a great illustration of a) Diaz's patient, calm, thoughtful, and aware jiu-jitsu, and b) a really, really, *really* common mistake people make when fighting. They grab onto \"something\" and refuse to let go even at the cost of losing the fight. Newbie BJJ mistake, you see it all the time in the gym. You see it even more in street fight videos. People grab that head and just hold on for dear life.\n\nHope that helped :)\n\n",
