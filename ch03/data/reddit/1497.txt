Agreed. This fight actually MADE me a Connor fan. I WANT him to defend his title and whoop ass. There is something about when a superstar eats humble pie that I think it will make them a better fighter, and I can relate to them more. Dunno, I'm rambling. 

All I know, is I didn't like seeing Connor lose like that, and up till now I haven't been a fan. Weird, huh?
