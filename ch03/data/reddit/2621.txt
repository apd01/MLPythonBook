Die hard McGreggor fan here. He makes every Irishman across the world proud to be Irish. Tonight is nothing but respect to Nate. He flat exposed my hero tonight. He tagged him took him down and went to work. Nate's BJJ is just different and it was an amazing fight. I'm sad and disappointed but as a MMA fan I can't be upset
