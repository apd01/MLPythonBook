I also remember Ray Borg being very vocal about not being able to get a fight, so maybe this stretches to the Flyweights too.\n\nSo i looked into it and there's currently 62 women on the UFC roster page over both the weight classes, yet only 7 women's fights booked in the next 10 shows - and 2 of those are happening this weekend.\n\nFor comparison there's 42 Heavyweights on the roster page, with 9 fights booked in the next 6 shows.\n\nPretty ridiculous if you ask me.
