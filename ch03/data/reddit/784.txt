I imagine Dana will be just fine, especially if GSP comes back to fight Lawler at UFC200. I mean, it's not like people aren't going to buy a card that features that, plus Conor-Frankie, and either Tate-Holm 2 or Tate-Rousey 3.

The only real loser tonight is RDA, who probably never gets his Red Panty Night payday now.
