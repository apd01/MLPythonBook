I think it's mixed, let's not forget that LW's usually cut from much higher weights and if they haven't been focusing on weight cutting they probably walk around 170-180. A lightweight after losing weight for the fight is still usually 165-170 before weighins. So yes Nate is a natural 155 but his walking weight is likely to be much higher than McGregors IMO. But I could be wrong
