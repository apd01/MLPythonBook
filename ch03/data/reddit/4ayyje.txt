Not sure how to unless you were there but find old forums or something. He has been held up by the UFC for 3 years because they didn't want him killing contenders. Conor already passed on him at 189 when he accepted the fight and instead opted for Mendes. Conor never talked shit on Frankie because he didn't want to actually bring interest into them fighting. Frankie actually fought at 155lbs against people 20+ lbs heavier than him and became champion. Prime Frankie would fuck Conor up (Of today. Maybe in 5 more years Conor will be much improved) and Conor knows, UFC knows, and above all Eric Silva knows. They will wait until Frankie ages and loses a step before ever making that match up. \n\nRDA wasn't as dangerous of a match up as it seems though. I honestly don't believe RDA would have been able to get Conor to the mat. RDA is not a good wrestler and his transitions are terrible. You know hes going for a takedown from a mile away. Somehow after this fight was booked everyone jumped on the RDA is the toughest opponent yet train and I'm sitting here like WTF?!?. His gameplan was likely to get Conor to the fence then try to get him down which I highly doubt he would have been able to do. \n\nRDA was a good fight to give the impression that Conor is fighting a well rounded opponent and silence the naysayers. I honestly thought Conor was going to beat RDA while I thought Frankie would crush him. Now after Conor lost to Diaz I'm not so sure.  \n", 
    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Edit: Also besides the point... who is saying hes ducking RDA? RDA isn&#39;t even in the weight class Conor is the Champion of. Follow Frankies career. Not sure how to unless you were there but find old forums or something. He has been held up by the UFC for 3 years because they didn&#39;t want him killing contenders. Conor already passed on him at 189 when he accepted the fight and instead opted for Mendes. Conor never talked shit on Frankie because he didn&#39;t want to actually bring interest into them fighting. Frankie actually fought at 155lbs against people 20+ lbs heavier than him and became champion. Prime Frankie would fuck Conor up (Of today. Maybe in 5 more years Conor will be much improved) and Conor knows, UFC knows, and above all Eric Silva knows. They will wait until Frankie ages and loses a step before ever making that match up. </p>\n\n<p>RDA wasn&#39;t as dangerous of a match up as it seems though. I honestly don&#39;t believe RDA would have been able to get Conor to the mat. RDA is not a good wrestler and his transitions are terrible. You know hes going for a takedown from a mile away. Somehow after this fight was booked everyone jumped on the RDA is the toughest opponent yet train and I&#39;m sitting here like WTF?!?. His gameplan was likely to get Conor to the fence then try to get him down which I highly doubt he would have been able to do. </p>\n\n<p>RDA was a good fight to give the impression that Conor is fighting a well rounded opponent and silence the naysayers. I honestly thought Conor was going to beat RDA while I thought Frankie would crush him. Now after Conor lost to Diaz I&#39;m not so sure.  </p>\n</div>",

I understand some people don't like Conor for his antics and don't see the appeal in his character but for me, I want to see him do well (and most importantly, people who aren't super deep into MMA do). It's also a case of if he does well, the UFC do well. I'm very into this fight personally. Does he deserve it? Not really... that doesn't mean I don't really want to see it again.

    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Coming from a McGregor fan who is inherently biased, I&#39;m actually into this rematch. It&#39;s what Conor symbolizes that sells this fight. The self-belief and aura he has. Even if it&#39;s deceptive. I want to see Conor tackle this again and win because it&#39;s a great story (if he wins anyway). I understand some people don&#39;t like Conor for his antics and don&#39;t see the appeal in his character but for me, I want to see him do well (and most importantly, people who aren&#39;t super deep into MMA do).

Not to mention Diaz is a far bigger name now than he was before 196 and that one still hit 1.5 mil.

Rumor is Conor walks around at 175 now, that is about a 30 pound weight cut, that is utterly brutal.  Don't be shocked if this fight is made, in a few weeks we get Aldo v Frankie for a vacant belt.  Conor can't defend a belt for a weight he can't make.  And he HAS TO get all the way to 145, doesn't get that extra pound when holding a belt",
