My theory. Nate is gonna fail for Marijuana metabolites just as Nick did. How's that for a "fuck you for banning my bro on some Bullshit?" statement? Like yeah call it a no contest but the world watched me beat your golden boy down. May make sense since Nate did take the fight on short notice, reportedly. 

This of course was a conversation amongst 6 stoned individuals. Makes more sense for Nate to have definitely have passed for another huge money fight.
