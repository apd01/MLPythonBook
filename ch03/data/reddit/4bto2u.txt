We are all just fans here having a discussion right?Besides it looks like to me that Conor could do more by listening to all the other fighters critiqueing him instead of insulting them. Most do want to see him succeed.\n\nRight and so we agree Conor's gameplans around left handed knockouts.  As far as well roundedness, I would say RDA, the Diaz Brothers, GSP, Anderson Silva, Jon Jones, Fabricio Werdum I mean you can go on and on have more than one go-to weapon right?After UFC 196 it can be agreed upon that both Holly Holm and Conor who are both good strikers, need more BJJ work too right?  So yeah its just a discussion and if you know your stuff good, to some of these new fans it helps them to understand that there is more to the sport that it has been longer since 2013 when Conor burst onto the scene.
