When you're truly elite, you can pull multiple weight classes off. Conor is just not elite.

In boxing, Mayweather went through 5 divisions, 24 pounds and still made everyone look foolish while never dehydrating. Pacquiao went through even more divisions and was still making much bigger man think twice about trading with him. The problem in MMA is the truly elite fighters don't even try to move up, because there is little incentive and a lot of risk.

Edit: I'll elaborate on that a bit, in boxing sticking to one division does not capture the public's imagination because a lot of fighters in the past have gone up and cleared out many divisions. To capture public interest and go somewhat mainstream you need to accomplish that, sticking to one division won't cut it. In MMA it hasnt been done yet and it's not EXPECTED, elite fighters will be marketed by the UFC even if they stick to one division and make good money. If they accept to go up a weight class, most of them won't get more $ in the first fight or two(because they can't market themselves like Conor) and risk losing and diminishing their value before seeing profit from the endeavor.
