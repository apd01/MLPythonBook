This is prior to the fight. He's a dick pre-fight to sell, after the fight he is all class. At the end of the Aldo fight he gave props to Aldo and said he wished it went a bit longer for his sake. In his interviews after fights he respects his opponents. Same with Nick and Nate. Talent alone won't rake in the numbers so he has to resort to playing an ass.
