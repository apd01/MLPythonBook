1) Conor should be at 155.  Meaning he realistically went up a single weight class 2) Chad Mendez would have beat his ass, even as a smaller opponent, if he had adequate time to prepare 3) Conor has established himself as a one trick pony.  Amazing striking, but Khabib or Askren would rag doll him. 4) What's the difference between holly and Conor's demise?  Conor taps as soon as he's in a choke hold.  Holly.. doesn't tap at all.  

This mcgregor hype is exactly that.
