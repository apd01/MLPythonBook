So... Can we officially declare a curse is almost definitely happening involving the cover stars on the UFC video games? Look at the track record.. 


UFC Undisputed 2009 - Forrest Griffon (Embarrassing KO to Silva)

UFC Undisputed 2010 - Brock Lesnar (Medical emergency takes him out of the sport indefinitely)

UFC Undisputed 3 - Anderson Silva (Lost title and broken leg)

EA UFC - Jon Jones & Alexander Gustafsson (Title stripped from him. Gus gets off kind of easy on this list as he has just kind of become background noise in the division)

EA UFC 2 - Ronda Rousey & Conor McGregor (Do I really even need to mention why?)
