Nicely put view. But I think you are playing too much into this all being down to Conor being overconfident. Nate fought awesome in there, and he beat Conor by being the better fighter. 

> Don't think he should be fighting at 170

As Joe nicely put, it was 'two lightweights fighting without the water cut'. I can see a lot of people saying '170' was too much of a jump for Conor, which is wrong. Conor is natural a lightweight, you can see that in how he near on kills himself getting down to featherweight.
