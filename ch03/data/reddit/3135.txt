This came down to one thing game plan. Conor tried to fight the same way he fights 145 with a lot of movement and free flowing shots. The issue is he hasn't fought at 170 before and his body was willing to keep that pace. Once round 2 started he was already gassed and then got caught and it was done.  He should have looked to be more efficient but let's not kid ourselves this wasn't and should have been a close fight he did too much and got caught.
