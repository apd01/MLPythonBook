It wasn't stupid, I mean he was getting hurt and outclassed on the feet. To keep fighting on the feet would have clearly lead to a KO. At that point, his only other option was to take it to the ground. It was the right call but Nate just outclassed him so it wasn't gonna end well either way. What a fuckin fight tho!
