Exogenous ketone supplementation right after a fight may help those neurons damaged from the trauma of robbie punches. You can look around for studies but part of the damage is that it interrupts the brains ability to fuel itself. Exogenous ketones or maybe just a ketogenic diet could be able to help with this. Maybe its 20 years away but I'm just trying to suggest that the reality of brain trauma we have today won't be the same forever, this has clearly been shown for other brain condition like seizures. \n\nstuff like this: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079995",
