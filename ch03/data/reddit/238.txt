>If you think Ronda is the first fighter that cried and considered suicide after losing a fight, you're not living in reality. 

People who criticize her for this are disgusting people. Ronda has had problems with depression in the past when her father committed suicide, and it's sometimes easier for people who have had suicidal ideation in the past to experience it again. How people who criticize the suicidal can consider themselves right-minded people is beyond me.
