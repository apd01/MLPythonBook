Eh honestly not surprised by the outcome after watching round 1.

3 things dictated this loss IMO:

1.) Size advantage, McGregor moving up to fight Nate at 170 definitely favors Nate far more than McGregor. I was already skeptical of McGregor moving up to 155 due to the size difference but he is a big FW but WW is pushing it far too head.

2.) Height advantage: McGregor fights with a long style in which he utilizes reach with straight punches and kicks. Nate's height made that incredibly difficult. A lot of times where McGregor would have normally landed shots Nate was able to move away due to the height difference. Not surprising there.

3.) Connor's defense: I feel Connor's defense is really similar to a fighter that generally has reach advantage where hands down can be okay given the range is usually in their favor. However against Nate, Connor's defense was incredibly weak and he attempted too many weaves and bobs to dodge instead of relying on any defense with his hands. Watching round 1 made me think that eventually Nate would win the war of attrition.

IMO this was a bad matchup for Connor as 1.) He's more of FW/LW. 2.) Nate is a long LW already. 

But Connor sealed his defeat with his cockiness in lowering his hands. Doesn't take away from how good he is but IMO in today's age it's way too difficult to succeed in multiple weight classes. BJ did it when the competition was weaker.
