Hey it's you again!

> Yeah the entire fight I was saying he looked slow and sloppy, like he wasn't ready for the weight class.

Yeah? I'm not gonna lie man, that first round it looked like McGregor was winning pretty strongly. Pretty early into the fight I was like "wow, ok. So McGregor's gonna win, just a matter of time" and in my defense, even Diaz said he was off to a slow start.

Nick gets cut a lot too on his eyebrow ridge. I heard he got some of his bone shaven down to try to improve that. Speaking of Nick, any idea when he's coming back??

Another question. Who would you want to see McGregor fight next? RDA or Frankie Edgar, or someone else? I'm feelin Edgar. After this I think RDA would run through McGregor
