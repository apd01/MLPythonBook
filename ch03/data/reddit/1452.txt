I guarantee the fact that Nate was taking his shots fucked with his confidence to an extent. Everyone else fell. When a knockout artist finds someone who can take their shots, it fucks with their confidence. After he was rocked, the will just got sucked out of him and fast. I believe there are quite a lot of fighters who in the situation, there heart would carry them through. But again... it's simply that he talks about other fighters not having will and being pussies and breaking easy. If he didn't do that so much, I wouldn't feel this way.
