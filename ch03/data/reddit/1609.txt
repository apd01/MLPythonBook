Oh man, that's exactly what I love about the sport. Any other sport you watch has a timer, and you watch until the end, and nobody can win until the end. Shit goes out the window in MMA, winning and losing happens on a dime, whether the timer is up or not.

The excitement and build up you mentioned was exactly what I felt watching the two mains, and I've been a fan since I was a kid watching UFC with my oldest brother and then renting them on VHS. The excitement never goes away. Such drama tonight!
