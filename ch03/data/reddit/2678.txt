I am so happy for Nate as i've been a fan of the Diaz brothers for a long time. But i don't understand the hate for Conor? Does he talk a lot, sure does, but he also fights very often and is a very entertaining fighter overall. I remember how much people shit on Anderson and Ronda when they lost (although i totally get the Ronda hate), it's a fighting sport, people lose.

I'll always like watching guys like Cowboy and Conor. They fight often, they are skilled and very fun to watch, win or lose.
