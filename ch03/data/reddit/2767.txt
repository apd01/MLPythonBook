It's been his biggest criticism throughout his career.

When he hits you, you generally hit him. He just tends to hit you a lot fucking harder.

When you aren't towering over your opponents, suddenly trading shots changes.

Despite all the circlejerk reverbs tonight I thought he started well, his left straight was moving so fucking fast, if they had clipped Nate just a little more square rather than cutting him, that would have been it I think.

But it didn't happen and Nate just added another page to the "if you try to stand and bang with a Diaz you will lose" mythos.
