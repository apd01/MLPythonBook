He ended up in top position landing strikes for the remainder of the round. Like you say, it&#39;s what you do when you get there, and Conor got on top and landed strikes.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, no good jiu jitsu player will happily sit against the cage on bottom. For one, the cage restricts your ability to move and for two, you are going to lose the fight in the judges eyes if you do that.</p>\n\n<p>So if you think that this exchange was Nate clowning and controlling Conor, man, you&#39;re just delusional and you give Diaz fans the same bad name that delusional Conor fans give themselves.</p>\n</div>",

Once I've got both ankles like that, I *rarely* fail to get the sweep. The difficulty is getting the other ankle, which Conor had. Leandro Lo, a lightweight bjj world champ, has used this sweep against Rodolfo Vieira, a heavyweight and absolute world champ,  multiple times. It's a great technique. \n\nYou can see nate get lifted off the floor and post his hands on the mat. Then he elects to punch Conor a couple times, since he's getting swept anyway. Then he gets a wrist and starts hunting triangle. \n\nI know we're all supposed to be hating Conor right now for some reason, but that's actually a very legit sweep and he did it well. It looked easy because nate knew when the sweep was inevitable, so he just went to guard. ",

And the fighters we all compare him to (Mendes, Frankie, Aldo, Nate...) are nearly all elite grapplers.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ninja Edit:</em> I do think Kavanaugh awarding him a brown belt in the cage for a fight that he won by knockout was a weird move. Conor also rarely does BJJ competitions (although he has done a few) and hasn&#39;t really shown much game off his back at all. Kavanaugh is legit but it&#39;s not inconceivable that he may have promoted Conor a bit early.</p>\n</div>",
