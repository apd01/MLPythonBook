Gotta admit I was wrong on this one. 

Started out about how I expected, but I didn't think Conor would fall off the rails so suddenly.  Im still not sure if he was heavily rocked, heavily gassed or both, but either way, Nate turned those tides.  

I suppose its not that surprising though.  Conor was throwing huge power the whole fight, and with frequency.  Not sure he expected Nate to be able to eat it.  A little offtopic, thought wed see a few more kicks.  Seemed like a huge advantage for Conor in the fight.
