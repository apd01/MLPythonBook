As soon as Diaz saw the buckle, the blood was in the water. Conor was done. Diaz might not have the same resume, but he has been in a lot of fights and knew exactly when the moment to ramp it up was. After the Mendez fight I was wondering how McGregor would do bouncing back when he takes big blows, and you are going to get that moving up weight classes. The guys are bigger, the hits are harder, and when you take a stunning blow it will take longer to recover. 145 to 170 is a huge jump and going against a great boxer just shows how much harder those blows are.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time though. Great fight, and crazy result. McGregor will learn a lot from it, and it will certainly be interesting to see where he goes from here. But you have to give credit to Diaz; took a lot of hard shots, opened his eye up completely, maintained poise and kept his head, and executed like a champ when he saw the window. Amazing.
