Conor has a powerful left shot. Thats it. Guy was gifted the mendes fight that shot him to Aldo. I'll give him the Aldo win because a punch is a punch and Aldo crumbled. Conor's kicks were ineffective because he can't kick worth shit. Reciting what Nate already said, Conor trains with nobodies and beat midgets.

Can you name any current fighter that is a star and refused to give an interview after a loss?
