So what?  he cuts a shit load of weight and it's universally accepted he should be at 155 which is where nate is at on a non 10 day notice.  You might be right about Chad.  That is opinion based on how inept conor is on the ground.  We're on the same page about conors skillset.  

The hype train is justified in terms of conors insanely good striking.  But there's a lot more to MMA than that as we just saw.

Edit: and the hype train just got demoted by 50% at minimum.

Edit 2: I talk as a fan.  conor would beat the fuck out of me with his right pinky toe alone.
