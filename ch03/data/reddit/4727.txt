[Spoiler]

This sucked. If Conor was ever going to lose, I pretty much wish it had been to anyone other than Nate Diaz -- the guy who can't speak a single sentence without droping four F-bombs.

On a side note, it seemed like a bad idea for Conor to move up in weight that much. Hopefully this is his last time... though I guess I wouldn't mind seeing a rematch...
