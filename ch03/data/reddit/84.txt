From the moment it was announced Diaz was gonna fight him at that weight I kept thinking that Diaz was gonna pull it off.  All week Connor was off his game and you can tell Diaz got in his head, Connor forgot that fake crazy (him) is nothing like real crazy (Diaz) and lost the shit talk/mind games.

Connor, like Tyson, beats most of his opponents before the fights even begins by fucking with their head. You could see multiple times in the fight where Connor was thrown off his game and Diaz proved Connor a one trick pony who uses smoke and mirrors and has no ground game like Lauzon said.
