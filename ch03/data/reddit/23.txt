You conorbots really don't get it. He is at his natural weight at 170 but kept it down to have a height and reach advantage. This, his speed and getting into his opponent's head was what made him win. If you take away what should be irrelewant to MMA he only has his speed. No chin, no ground game.   
People call that a one-trick-pony. And all of you bots were mislead by a narcissistic false prophet.  
So, Stockton MF.
