I could see that coming, from early in the second round onwards.

Conor was teeing off on Diaz's face for 5 minutes in the 1st, fighting at his own pace. Tearing up Diaz's face, pinging punches off his head, swinging for the fences. He was comfortable, too comfortable.

But Diaz was still in there.

Conor looked too self-assured, got too relaxed, showed too much of his chin to Diaz in his overconfidence that Diaz didn't pose enough of a threat to him in return. He thought he had Diaz right where he wanted him, but then Diaz rode out the storm, Conor tired very quickly, and in his over confidence was caught flush on the chin with a counter and seriously rocked.

And at that moment the fight completely swung.

He never recovered from that punch, and it seemed it was exacerbated by fatigue.

They then clinched for a bit, Conor still took punches against the fence in the clinch, and clearly still hadn't recovered. Once they broke he took more straightforward punches in the exchange, his elusiveness was completely gone, he was right on the edge of being ko'd still, and in desperation he tried to take Diaz down.

It was a lame effort, he was as good as done. Diaz defended it, mounted him, caught him with a few punches, Conor showed his back half out cold, and Diaz ended it with the rear naked choke.

I think what this fight showed is that Conor had never had someone eat those kind of punches, and keep coming back for more. His power didn't translate to 170lbs from 145lbs. And he hadn't accounted for that. His overconfidence that Diaz would eventually succumb, and didn't pose much of a threat in return, really cost him as he faded with fatigue in a completely alien place of expending himself that much and his opponent not going down.

Don't think he should be fighting at 170
