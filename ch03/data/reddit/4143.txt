Damn two fights I was wrong on. I wanted Holy Holm to win and I was certian she would win. On the other hand I wanted Diaz to win but I was sure Conor would be victorious. This was an amazing card to watch and witness,  I haven't been this excited watching UFC in a long time. I'm sure this will be full of Conoor shitposts but this isn't one of them. I have great respect for Conor; he trained for a fight against DOS Anjos but took a short notice fight against Nate. I have even more respect for Nate on taking the short notice fight. This was truly an amazing UFC card and I'm happy I got to see it live.
