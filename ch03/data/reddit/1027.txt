McGregor and his goofy movement coach, Ido Portal were doing some very odd exercises during the open workout (I think). They were facing each other, and Ido was trying to tap conor's hips while Conor sort of gyrated out of the way. Nate had the absolute best dig on McGregor when he said, "You were playing touch butt with that dork in the park"
