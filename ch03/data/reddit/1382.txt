This would probably be more akin to Connor trying to employ the Chuck Liddel strategy, in that he attempts to bait you with his face. Chuck Liddel also had a cast iron chin. Chuck Liddel's footwork in regards to cutting angles was actually pretty good. And by doing that, you try to bait the other person to over commit. A lot of power gets generated if the other person over commits since it's the sum of the momentum of your body and theirs.

That's basically what happened. Conor tried to bait Nate into over commiting. But Nate's tall. He doesn't have to take in the extra step to land a good jab to the face. But more importantly, the Diaz brothers both don't over commit to punches either. Which makes this an extremely awkward fight for someone especially of Conor's style. 

And it showed. Conor's left hand, while accurate, didn't do nearly as much damage as it would have normally done. Conor decided to brawl with Nate. He got gassed. Nate slowly turned up those fifty percent shots, and Conor's chin finally started to cave.

I can't help but think that Conor also lost the mind game in this one. With all the shit talking going around, Conor I feel wanted to go in and win with authority. Perhaps he didn't get angry like the way Jose Aldo did. But he certainly didn't fight smart against Diaz.
