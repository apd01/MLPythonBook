Anyone who thought Conor was taking this was drinking the special kool-aid...so hyped to see Diaz shut Conor and the hype train up. Still love McGregor, excellent fighter but you can't move up 25 pounds in < 3 months and expect to compete. I'm sure he's happy with his cheque, probably wasn't too confident coming in, but at least he's got his money!
