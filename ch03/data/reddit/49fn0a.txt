    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Pretty sure Conor comes back a better fighter from this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He definitely will. He was already spot on with his self-analysis like 30 minutes after the fight, basically saying he abandoned the body shots and kicks and over-exerted himself thinking he had Diaz hurt, and also admitting that he went into panic mode. He won round 1 imo (even though Nate was taking it slow). He basically surrendered with that takedown attempt, I don&#39;t think his ground game is as bad as people think; he was rocked hard and would&#39;ve been knocked out or TKO&#39;d soon if not submitted.</p>\n\n<p>I think with a smarter approach it&#39;s a great fight, especially at 155 and with full camp Diaz. Would be lots of fun.</p>\n</div>",
