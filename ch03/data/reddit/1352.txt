I think only the Conor maniacs were talking about that fight as if Conor had a chance though. I think everyone else just wanted to see the spectacle of it all. Nate making him and Nick some money and winning (with the added benefit of a fuck you to Dana White) is the best timeline, but everyone has that part of them that just wants to see shit hit the fan.
