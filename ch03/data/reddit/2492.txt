Nah, people wanted GSP to go up to middleweight where he would be seriously out sized by Anderson.

This was literally two lightweight fighters fighting without cutting water. Conor was actually going to be taller and longer reach than RDA. We also saw from the weigh ins that he was just as girthy as Nate.
