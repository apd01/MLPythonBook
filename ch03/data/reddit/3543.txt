Conor and a lot of others need to understand that there was no weight advantage here . Rogan said it in the beginning about how interesting this fight will be when both fighters didn't have to cut weight. 
So what we had here last night was 2 natural 168'ers that didn't have to cut, and are having a fight in their natural walking around weight. 
So they were on equal terms , and the better man won.
