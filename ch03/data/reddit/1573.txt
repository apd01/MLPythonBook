Lol abso-fucking-lutely. DC and Jones are Light Heavyweight (205lbs). But before we get that far they need to cross Middleweight (185lbs) champ Luke Rockhold. There's no legal way Nate or Conor would beat Rockhold, he would head kick them to sleep. So yes Nate or Conor going to 205 (if even possible for their frame) will be suicide.
