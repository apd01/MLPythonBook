I'm not a Conor fan and was ecstatic to see him humbled, but you have to give the man props for always taking whatever fights are thrown at him. Changing from Jose to Mendes and RDA to Nate on short notice. He was humble in defeat and I'll always look forward to his fights. 

This will be the opportunity for all the haters to jump on him, but take away the talking he does to promote the fights and you have a fighter every MMA should love.
