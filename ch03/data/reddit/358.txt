That's exactly what I said earlier today. 

I like Conor much more post-match. He seems to be himself, and isn't anymore trying to sell a fight. Post-fight he is just himself, and he seems like a nice guy to hang around with, compared to the pre-match Conor where all he talks about his money. 

Pre-match he can be fun, but it gets tiring after a while.
