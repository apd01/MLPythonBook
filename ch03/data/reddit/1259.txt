First of all, I would never say he's better than Jones.

But, adding weight instead of cutting it can also have a negative effect on your gas tank if you gain too much without the proper cardio, etc. All that extra muscle has to be fed, and I'm sure he was conditioning and preparing for a 155 fight. Just 10 lbs above what he's used too. Instead they fought at 170, so neither guy had to cut weight, but it's still 25 lbs above the weight he's used too, and much closer to Nate's natural weight probably. As well as a weight Nate has won some fights at. 

Honestly anything can happen in a fight like this where both fighters are preparing for each other on short notice and both are outside of their normal weight classes, though I'm always going to lean towards the naturally bigger guy having the edge regardless of the odds on winner, etc.
