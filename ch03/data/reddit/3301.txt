Dunno, this fight showed that he can quickly run out of options if his lefty isnt putting his opponent out. You put a guy like rda who wont stand in front of you, and will move around, kick your leg, take you down, gnp... he will need to increase his gas tank about 4 times just to handle the pace that rda can bring.

There is always the chance of him landing a nice first round shot and winning, but lets be honest, every minute that passes by his chances will be decreasing together with his punching power.
