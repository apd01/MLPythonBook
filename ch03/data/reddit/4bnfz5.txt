Im literally learning to walk properly again. Without weed I think honestly I would've turned towards a bottle instead. I've trained martial arts and Olympic style athletics for my life also, but in the last year i turned to walking for as long as possible,  ive built up too 2 hours straight with out falling over anymore, so no running anymore for me. My advice for you would be to break your volume of training up while keeping frequency and intensity of work ethic. It might feel like your doing yourself a disservice but it can help if your pain is chronic. If not yet chronic, just break it up and train your posture on your own time but consistently, you will see improvements either way and it will give you the base you need to go forward for that functional strength in health and body normalcy. Body Weight strength and balance (calisthenics) with the rest of your training is the least debilitating over time  I think and the most functional, outside of powerlifting. If you try that let me know how it works out for you, I'm postive it should help. This is my life for at least a year as I will be in a wheelchair if I don't keep going. Posture can get major bad from small past injuries. I have a lot of stuff for rehabilitation exercises for shoulders, back, and hips depending on what you need, just let me know if you want them",
