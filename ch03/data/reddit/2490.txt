Good comment, I certainly respect Conor for al the hype and excitement he's been able to generate. However, I have a feeling that before fighting at a higher weight again he'll have to clean out his division and fight Edgar, or at least not have a clear contender for the belt.  

It was risky what he did, moving up. Crazy fun though. Imagine if he managed to win?
