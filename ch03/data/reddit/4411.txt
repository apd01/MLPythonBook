Dana just lost all of his favored fighters (Ronda Rousey and Conor McGregor). It's also pretty funny that both Conor and Ronda got outboxed after talking about fighting Floyd Mayweather. I'mnot even a big Mayweather fan, but it was just annoying to hear these two talking so much about a retired boxer.
