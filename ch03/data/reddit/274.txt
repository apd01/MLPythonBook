yeah that one clip ignores all the pre-hype build up, the two times he snatched aldo's belt telling Aldo he was going to die, putting his hands on Aldo's shoulders, running at him in the crowd after the Dennis silver fight claiming he bounced Aldo's head off the canvas during the 196 prefight conference. How about Calling out two heavy weight champions for pulling out of a fight because they were injured. Even before 196 Mcgregor was still calling Aldo a pussy for pulling out the first time for a broken rib.

Not disrepectful? LOL the guy took over the post fight conference after beating Aldo walking around claiming he was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 best pound for pound and then DJ and JBJ is somewhere behind him.
