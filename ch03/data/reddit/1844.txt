Yup guys this is classic "regression to the mean"- you make a thing that rewards people for acting exceptionally who for a moment seem untouchable and then you say they're cursed when they simply come back down to the average. And you're not tracking any of the other guys and finding a particular meaning in their wuss and losses or weird scenarios.
