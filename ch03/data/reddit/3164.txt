If you think it's all an act you've seriously gotta be deluded.

Now part of it is that the environment they've putting the fighters in. Obviously the press conference exists to facilitate hype/banter/tension between the fighters. 

However, almost *no one* acts like he does. He is literally anything but humble. He flatus his money, he berates his opponents, he acts like he's a god walking among mortals. 

Their is literally no objective way to quantify him as 'humble' when you compare him to any other athlete.

"Humble in victory of defeat" 

This is literally like the most asinine piece of doublespeak I've ever heard. It's super easy to be humble directly after a win or loss. 

You have nothing to gain by acting like a jackass if you win, and you have nothing to gain by acting like a jackass if you lose. I mean typically when you win something and the press is off your entire state of mind changes to something akin to relief/happiness. You have to try really hard to be a sore winner. 

I don't even care if someone is humble or not. I don't think anyone *needs* to be humble, but don't call someone humble if they're not. Just because he says he's humble doesn't make him humble.

His actions dictate how he is perceived. He doesn't act in a humble manner for a majority of the press/media he does. He typically goes beyond normal trash talk and actually attacks a persons character / personal life instead of just their fighting ability. How is that humble whatsoever?
