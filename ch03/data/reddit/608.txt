It works both ways. No question Conor was the smaller man here, and he has big fookin' balls going up against Nate Diaz. He did well all things considering. For me, Conor still has all my respect, he was willing to FIGHT a dangerous opponent and he was all game. Great fight all around, both fighters deserve NOTHING but praise. I didn't pay to watch this fight, but Nate and Conor damn sure made me wish I did. That's how much I enjoyed the contest.
