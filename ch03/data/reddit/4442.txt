Conor was the most interesting thing in the UFC. The perfect storm of exciting personality, exciting fighting style, and willing to fight anyone. Do you know how refreshing that is when guys pull out of fights constantly, and fight only twice a year. 

If this would have been for the title, I would be fucking pumped for Diaz. However, all that happens now is we a champion who just lost as champion still holding a title, and a guy with a big victory who probably won't do anything else with his career. If I HAD to see Conor lose, I would prefer it to be in a fight with something on the line, not what essentially was an exhibition fight.
