I'm not sure what your point is. Conor has the 2nd highest grossing ppv ever despite fighting at only145 lbs, and GSP is the UFC's biggest ppv draw ever with the exception of perhaps only Brock Lesnar; and it's very possible that they're both going to be on the card of UFC 200 (and maybe Rousey too). And again, they're two weight classes apart; saying that Conor and/or GSP are losing out because they won't ever fight each other now is like saying Anderson Silva missed out by not getting a chance to fight Brock Lesnar back in the day.
