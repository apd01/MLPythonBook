Unlike most fighters who wait until you get hit and hurt then stand around looking for the perfect punch until you're 10 feet away recovering the Diaz strategy is to keep throwing at all times so once you're hit and they're hurt, they're hit a few more times so they're standing in front of you instead of ten feet away.
