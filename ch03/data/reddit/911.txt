There's no doubt grappling is harder physically than standing up against a bigger man, I wouldnt expect MMA fighters to clear 3-4 divisions, ever. But going up 10 pounds even with the ground fighting and grappling is in no way as much of a problem as going up 25 pounds standing like elite boxers do. People start walking right through your punches. The wieght difference between 185 and 205 might be too much to move up also, the guys at 205 look really huge.

You pretty much saw it tonight, there wasnt much grappling and the fight lasted 9 minutes mostly standing... The bigger guy starts walking through your shots so you better have something else than power and accuracy and you better be able to take a big man's punch or not get hit, obviously.
