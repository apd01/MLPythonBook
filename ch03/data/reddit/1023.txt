On top of fighting top guys for a long time, styles make fights

Nate was just a bad match up for Conor. Conor's main tool is his stand up and Diaz's stand up is one of the best. The question was will Diaz chin hold up and it most certainly did.  

So it was just stand up vs stand up and Diaz was sharper and had the better chin. Plus Nate is very good on the ground. While Conor only really has his stand up as a threat and in MMA that can only get you so far. 

Another reason is Conor up until now was fighting smaller guys than him. Now he fought someone who is his weight but also longer and with a bigger reach. A lot of Conors punches were ending up short.
