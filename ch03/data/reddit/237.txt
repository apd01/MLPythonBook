Dude, I think Ronda's antics are as lame as the next person does, but why is it that this sub is so bizarrely obsessed with not giving her credit for anything? You know the new WBM champ? Ronda finished her 2 times with the same technique. The division would have not existed in the UFC without Ronda. She had a 12-0 career of finishes, 11 in the first round. Until Holm, her entire ring time wasn't a 5 round fight. All of this turned a broke ex-Olympian into literally the biggest star EVER in MMA within 24 months. 

That's incredible. She's achieved more than anyone could have ever imagined, and helped the sport grow immensely. She *is* a once ever fighter. Her brain is completely delusional from that. 

If you think Ronda is the first fighter that cried and considered suicide after losing a fight, you're not living in reality. Her career, the people she inspired, her entire world was shattered in 7 minutes. She went from being a hero to a punchline. 

So yeah, Ronda is annoying. She's acted like a 12 year old and made me cringe as much as anyone else. Her coach should be working at a convenience store in Brooklyn selling counterfeit lotto tickets. But for fuck's sake, let's give credit where it's due. She's not even cleared to train yet.
