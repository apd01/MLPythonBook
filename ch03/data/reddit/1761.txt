WW champ is Robbie Lawler. No fight scheduled yet(im pretty sure). But Nate Diaz is a light weight fighter and the LW champ is Rafael Dos Anjos. Conor was supposed to fight him before he got injured

Edit: in terms of Diaz fighting Dos Anjos, yeah its quite likely as i dont think conor will get a shot now
