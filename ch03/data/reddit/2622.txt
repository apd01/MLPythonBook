Nate didn't take Connor down - that's important. Connor was desperate and shot for the takedown, and then Nate went to work. Nate stood and traded with him until Connor couldn't do it anymore.

That aside - it was one hell of a fight. Fantastic show by both fighters - I'm excited to see where Connor goes from here, and I'm even more excited about Nate getting the recognition he deserves. I think he's often overshadowed by Nick, but this fight should hopefully help him overcome that a bit more.
