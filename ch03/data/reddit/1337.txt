The problem is the insinuation that it was because he was vs a welterweight in a welterweight fight, when the reality is that he was vs a lightweight in a welterweight fight. 

All the 155ers will get into the ring as heavy as Nate and McGregor were tonight. If he wants to fight at 155 he will either need to stay as big as he was tonight and cut down to 155 from that weight like Nate and all the other lightweights, or he can cut some mass and give up a significant weight advantage in exchange for speed and more gas.

Otherwise he needs to stay at 145 where he can dominate people. He could compete and be a contender at 155 for sure, but its unlikely he'd be champ at 155.
