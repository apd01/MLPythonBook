She definitely tapped the shoulder. Twice, if I recall correctly. John just missed it because they were a bit half-assed. 

EDIT: Just rewatched the gif. She does a half ass tap (very very very very close to a fake tap...) moments after meisha lands on her back. Because John does not stop there, she goes a couple seconds longer then tries to tap again, but goes out in the middle of the action, causing her arms to flail. 

TL;DR Holly did in fact tap (possibly even fake tapped) then unsuccessfully  went for a real tap too late and went out.
