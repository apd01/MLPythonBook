People cut the maximum amount of weight that they can in the fight game. Diaz was probably about 185 when they fought each other after fully hydrated. Connor cut nothing and walked in at 168 or so. Nearly 20 lbs is significant. Nate also has the skull of a monkey with that small ass brain of his. Hard as shit to knockout and Conor said himself that he overexhausted himself over throwing punches. Made it more about energy but that is essentially what he said. He never should have taken that fight.

As for this Chad Menedez bullshit.
1. Conor was prepping for Aldo, totally different fighter so he too was at an equal disadvantage.
2. As a fighter you better be ready when your number is called to step up. Both men did and the better man won.

Conor has to work on his ground game and takedown defense and he admits that but he is the best in the featherweight division and will silence all of his critics. He makes no excuses and is humble in defeat. He is a champion.
