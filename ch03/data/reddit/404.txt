I really want to hear from McGregor what his thought process was when he devices to shoot. I know "panicked fighters become wrestlers" but McGregor send smarter than that. Like did he think the fight was going to slow down? Did he think Nate's ego was so big he wouldn't take advantage of being on the ground? Taking wonderboy to the ground is a viable strategy. Taking Nate to the ground? It just doesn't make sense.
