I got so much shit for saying this isn't the first "Conor" we've seen a few days ago. Dude saying so much shit, but really having very few legit Top 10 fights to his record, and then he comes in against a dude that is flat out not scared of him and has physical advantages and it's a different story entirely. Conor's not the first, and he won't be the last.
