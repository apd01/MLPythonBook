The one thing I really noticed when watching with my brother was that Conor was really swinging for the fences with nearly every punch in the first round. His Aldo knockout and all his own talk must have gotten to him a little bit. To be fair, I was legitimately concerned Nate was going to eat one of those and go to sleep, but my brother and I both thought there was a good chance he could gas hard in the 2nd.
