Thing is if Conor walks into the ring at 155 in a Lightweight fight, there are still guys way bigger than Nate in the lightweight division. Khabib walks around at 194 lbs / 88 kg.

I almost feel like he'd have to at least stay this big, and maybe just take more time to allow his body acclimatize to that weight and see if that makes a difference. But then that would probably mean he wouldn't be able to go back down to defend his belt.
