Wake up call for McGregor. He needs to go back to basics and fight with a proper gameplan. He's gotten like Anderson Silva of late, showboating and leaving his chin exposed, eating shots. 

With a good gameplan he would likely have won that fight, kicking Nate's legs and moving in when appropriate, instead swinging bombs and gassing himself. Nate was solid and did what he always, took shots and boxed smartly.
