UFC 200, probably vs Edgar, on a card that - if the rumors are true - will likely have 3 of the UFC's 4 biggest ppv draws ever fighting on it. When he wins vs a fighter that's not two weight divisions above him, the hype train starts up again. The only thing last night's loss did is force him to fight Edgar and probably rematch Aldo before moving up to 155 lbs. 

And honestly, all of those fights you mentioned at 170 are terrible ideas. Robby Lawler or Johny Henricks might have straight up hospitalized Conor. They're just too big, and Conor doesn't have enough of a skill advantage anywhere in his game to negate the size. All other things being equal, the big man will beat the little man pretty much every single time regardless of the names involved. I mean, for example, sure GSP vs Jon Jones would do 2 million ppv buys also, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea long term for anyone involved.

Like I said above, the only real loser in all of this is RDA who realistically might not be champion when Conor fights for the 155 belt and possibly never sees the Red Panty Night payday now.
