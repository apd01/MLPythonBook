True. MMA is amazing because nobody is invincible. Conor had to know that eventually he his mouth would write a check that his ass couldn't cash.  (...There's something awesome about watching amazing displays of heart put by supposed underdogs.)

Conor ate some humble pie (as well as quite a few jabs) and likely will never gain back the mystique he had before last night. 

But, he still has the featherweight belt to defend and is the first UFC fighter to earn a million dollars inside the cage. His overconfidence and trash talk is what helped him get to that type of payday.
