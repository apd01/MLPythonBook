Very cool to see Diaz get his moment in the spotlight.

 You could see that McGregor was getting exhausted even after the first round, Exactly like he said he fought inefficiently, maybe partly from the jump in weight but his work rate was too high. He was really fucking Diaz up, Then he hit a wall and got caught, from there he was spent and it was over. 

I don't agree with Rogan saying his jiu jitsu got exposed though, He was hurt and exhausted which is why he had no defense.
