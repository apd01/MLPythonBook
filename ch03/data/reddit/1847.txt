Its not a curse. Games take a couple years, or at least a year to make, market, and release. Thats a long time to stay champ/relevant. They are always trying to capitalize on current fighter popularity but cant get the game made fast enough to ride the coat tails of their apex popularity. By the time they get there, they are too late. 

They shouldnt announce the covers until weeks before, or maybe not until the game is released; that way they can switch it up if they need to.

but i digress
