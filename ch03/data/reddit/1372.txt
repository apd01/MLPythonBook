Without a doubt, Conner was much faster but just doesn't have the strength, chin or heart to move up a class yet. I like Nate but don't love him and didn't question this fight for a second -  Conner is a figment that didn't deserve his position just like Rhonda... 

Hype does not equate a champion.
