As a Conor fan I had hope he'd be able to move up to this weight class and win just like Floyd Mayweather did. But after watching this fight I don't see anyway he can be competitive at this weight. He was too small, to weak. He exploited the cuttability (I know that's not a word) of Diaz yet wasn't able to put him away even though he was bleeding like a stuck pig. He should stick to the lower weights I feel.
