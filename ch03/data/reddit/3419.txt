I agree that he's not THAT good, but he can get better. I think GSP is the greatest ever, and he got better with every fight, rather then starting off with unbelievable skills like Jon Jones (Although Georges was pretty good right off the bat too). Considering his work ethic, i don't think it's impossible that Conor bounces back and starts making a claim for greatest ever. He's got a long road ahead though.
