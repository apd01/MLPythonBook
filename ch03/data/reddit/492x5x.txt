I mean I get it - playing the upstanding citizen, Mr.Morality - it's not going to win you any favor with the Irish crowd.  But let's dig into why he hates Jon Jones so much and why he acts that way.\n\nWhen DC was a child his school friend was killed in a car accident.  A year after that his cousin was killed in a car accident.  But worst of all, in 2003 his infant daughter was killed in a car accident (struck by an 18 wheeler).\n\nSo given that Jon Jones' one great vice is driving impaired, I can understand the way DC was seething.  He seems overcome by anger when dealing with Jon, and I think this is a big part of it.\n\nHopefully he can harness all that rage and give 5 rounds of everything he's got come the day.  But don't boo this guy - DC has been a great champion.  In his shoes I think we'd all feel the same way.",

Hero&#39;s and villain&#39;s are elected and impeached over the course of 15 minutes. A perfect case in point was UFC 93, when Tom Egan fought Hathaway. Egan came out like a hero, and Hathaway got booed as the villain of the piece. After he had won the fight Hathaway received a massive cheer from the crowd. He had done his job, fought his fight and gotten his win...and in doing so he had earned the respect of the crowd that was heavily in support of his opponent. That&#39;s just how we are, doesn&#39;t matter where the fuck you are from or who you are, you can earn your round of applause from us by just doing your job. </p>\n</div>",

What compete and total nonsense.\n\nMighty Mouse talked a whole bunch of shit to Dodson before their rematch.. He even treated him quite condescendingly after winning. Look at the smirk and point he did to Cejudo at the face off yesterday. All that shit talking to his opponents does not mean he's a jerk or a monster or some kind of terrible person. No sensible person would argue that.\n\nJones talking shit to DC and calling him a pussy has literally nothing to do with whether or not Jon has cleaned up his life. Its all about what athletes and competitors have done since day one. \n\nPeople like Jones. He's one of the best ever. DC playing the \"poor why are you booing me\" card is slightly bs. Jones has been gone for quite a while, why is he surprised that people are going to cheer his return. \n\nDC has no problem making light of Jones' drug problems and problems with soberity on twitter and instagram because it makes him feel good/laugh, and takes a shot at Jones. But then at the same time he's upset that fans want to believe that Jones has changed and is trying to stay clean. \n\nDC's way of trash talking is to demean his opponents as opposed to bigging himself up. Before he fought Gus he kept saying that Gus's biggest fight was one that he lost. Now he's trying to paint Jones as some kind of unrepetnant monster who is pulling a ruse on everyone. And his proof of that is he called him a pussy...nope not buying it. ",

What compete and total nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>Mighty Mouse talked a whole bunch of shit to Dodson before their rematch.. He even treated him quite condescendingly after winning. Look at the smirk and point he did to Cejudo at the face off yesterday. All that shit talking to his opponents does not mean he&#39;s a jerk or a monster or some kind of terrible person. No sensible person would argue that.</p>\n\n<p>Jones talking shit to DC and calling him a pussy has literally nothing to do with whether or not Jon has cleaned up his life. Its all about what athletes and competitors have done since day one. </p>\n\n<p>People like Jones. He&#39;s one of the best ever. DC playing the &quot;poor why are you booing me&quot; card is slightly bs. Jones has been gone for quite a while, why is he surprised that people are going to cheer his return. </p>\n\n<p>DC has no problem making light of Jones&#39; drug problems and problems with soberity on twitter and instagram because it makes him feel good/laugh, and takes a shot at Jones. But then at the same time he&#39;s upset that fans want to believe that Jones has changed and is trying to stay clean. </p>\n\n<p>DC&#39;s way of trash talking is to demean his opponents as opposed to bigging himself up. Before he fought Gus he kept saying that Gus&#39;s biggest fight was one that he lost. Now he&#39;s trying to paint Jones as some kind of unrepetnant monster who is pulling a ruse on everyone.

What your talking about is heartbreaking and the UFC did a great job of telling us all that in one of their promos, I think it was before the Johnson fight, in fact I shed a tear. He constantly throws Jones past in his face and then yesterday, things said before the presser were his only ammunition, he is showing a side of him that no one really likes. He is trying to convince that Jones is a bully and we shouldn&#39;t like him for that reason. The problem is that we like Jones because he is a bully that can himself with amazing skills. He should talk about how and why he is going to beat jones and not boohoo he called me a name. At least he has dropped the bow tie.</p>\n</div>",
