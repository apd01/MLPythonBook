It&#39;s a legitimate throw in Judo, but rarely used due to it&#39;s level of immediate danger to the joint.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been raving about the throw/armlock for years, wondering why no one else used it. I assumed everyone would start after Jones did it to Glover. Oddly? That never happened. A lot of guys just aren&#39;t quite sociopathic enough to break someone&#39;s arm/shoulder without giving them courtesy time to tap. </p>\n\n<p>Not too surprising that the LHW and LW GOATS, likely both legitimate ASPD-candidates, share such a rare feat in terms of creativity and viciousness. </p>\n</div>",
