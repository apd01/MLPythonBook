This is a winnable fight for McGregor. He has the speed advantage and is a much more diverse striker. He just got sucked into Diaz' game and was headhunting instead of following the blueprint that has been laid out to beat the Diaz bros. Leg kick and keep distance. Don't stay at their range. If Connor fought more like condit against nick he would have coasted to a decision (thank god he didn't because that was boring as shit). He did not fight smart at all here and was going for the big KO against a guy who is not going down unless you simply land the perfect strike on the button. The weight had nothing to do with it. They were probably within 5 lbs of each other.
