Yeah, I'm fairly new and I like McGregor because he's entertaining as hell and I know fuck all about the fighters in the ufc. I watch the fights and either have to root for someone arbitrarily or just root for a good fight (usually what I do). Guys like McGregor and Rousey may be a pain in the ass to veteran UFC fans, but they bring in the viewers.
