I know what you mean, but I don't think saying that they're "fighting at 170" is correct either, as they didn't have to cut weight before the fight. They just fought at their normal, daily weight; it seemed like to me.

But I agree that Conor looked sluggish. You can't keep your stamina after gaining so much weight in a short period of time. I am surprised he approached the weight-gain in this kind of way.
