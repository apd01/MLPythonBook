Actually, I don't think the hate will be any where near what Rousey got. Conor puts on exciting fights for the fans and took on a monster like Diaz on ten days notice. He then decides to box with him. That's ballsy and cost him dearly. I have respect for what Conor did even though I wanted Diaz to win.
