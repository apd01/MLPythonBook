Eh, watch the fight again. Conor was landing at will. Again, he threw some flashy kicks, tired himself out, and Nate started getting the best of him, before that, it was Conor landing shot after shot. I know the Diaz bros cut easy, but Nate was getting out boxed, plain and simple, his chin is insane, MOST guys would've gone down after taking a beating like that.
