There were suttle tells in McGregor that his gas tank wasnt going to be the same at 170. He looked a little more tired than usual at the open workouts after hitting pads. We all knew that his weakness is his ground game and we also hadnt seen him against such a lengthy opponent. Just goes to show size does matter at the highest levels.
