Yeah I guess it is. And that's apart of what makes  Conor's persona soo great too. But its just disapointing to see him throw away a fight like that that I think he easily could have won if he hadve stayed focused and not toyed around. But then again look at what happened to Holly! She fraught soo well and got caught with one slip up in the last few minutes and that was that! Who's to say Diaz wouldn't have found another opening? But yeah, it's all apart of the game.
