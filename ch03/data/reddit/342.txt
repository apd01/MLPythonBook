Yeah I see him beating Edgar too. That said, I also saw him beating Diaz tn so who the fuck knows. 

>That first round was easily McGregor's but watching his punches you could see a MAJOR difference in his speed and accuracy. He missed a lot of punches and wasn't recoiling nearly as quickly as he does at 145

Huh. I wasn't picking up on that, gotta rewatch it. He was missing for sure, but he was looking pretty accurate in that first round overall as I remember it.

Duuude I just remember Cruz and Faber 3 is happening. That's gonna be sick too. Kind of like this fight, I love Cruz but kind of want to see Faber win. Cruz is kind of douchey and it'd be nice to see Faber get some belt-action for once. Cruz is in my top 3 favorites fighters tho.
