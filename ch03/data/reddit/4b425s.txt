His rein was short though because he was knocked out in his next fight by non other than Lyoto Machida (who is fighting Dan Henderson in the fight before this one). Notable wins: Chuck Liddell, Forrest Griffin, Stephan Bonnar, Michael Bisping, Thiago Silva, Rampage Jackson, Tito Ortiz, Phil Davis, Dan Henderson, and Chael Sonnen. \n\nRashad is also very entertaining outside of the ring, and his season as a coach on the Ultimate Fight opposite of Rampage Jackson, is pretty much [carried by their antics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8QnRTXg2fg). \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Lyoto \"The Dragon\" Machida**: Future Hall of Famer.
