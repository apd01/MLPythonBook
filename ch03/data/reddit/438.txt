There was a chance he catches Lawler right when he declines before someone else does. Lawler has been in some 5 round battles. Hes going to take a shit here sooner or later.

BTW in McGregors defense, I'm sure he didn't do much boxing training in preparation for rda, I'd say he shouldn't be completely counted out, Diaz was short on camp but is pretty consistent with boxing and their Jiu-jitsu, him and his brother.
