It happened with ronda and conor and a little bit cain, it seems as though once the hype reaches critical mass and people start believing that the champion is unbeatable, if only for the time being, they lose. People tend to forget Cejudo was a low seed in the 2008 olympics, he wrestled the tournament of his life, headlocked the 2 ranked japanese guy in the final seconds to win, and rose to the occasion like a champion. I think that although he hasnt necessarily shown his wrestling, its levels ahead of dj&#39;s. like hollys boxing compared to rondas</p>\n</div>",
