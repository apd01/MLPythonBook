Conor kinda got me back into MMA but it definitely is always good for the sport when anyone can lose at any time, because anyone can win at any time as well.  I was watching Diaz' last fight and did not think there was any way he would get that fight with McGregor but he did and didn't back down as always.  That was a great fight and I hope MMA keeps growing. I just wish it went a few rounds longer, although that might just be because I love those long drawn out fights (I really started watching UFC after I stumbled upon Guida vs. Sanchez when switching channels).
