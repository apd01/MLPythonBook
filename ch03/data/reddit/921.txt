You remember the last time a smaller man made fun of Rory in the buildup? BJ Penn? Rory was KILLING him but didn't finish it, and in one of his post-fight interviews he explained that because of BJ's trash talk, he kept the fight going just to hit him some more... McGregor v McDonald sounds to me like... I dunno, a can crushing a can, then uncrushing just to crush it again repeatedly.
