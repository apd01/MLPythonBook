I get that crossfit's core moves are compound movements that work when done right. However, I feel that the emphasis places on high reps kills it. By focusing on high reps ppl sacrifice form and end up doing more harm than good. Also, iirc, Rich Froning himself doesn't "do" crossfit, he trains traditionally and then shows up at the games.
