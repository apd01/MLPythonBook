The main thing is that opinion is divided on all fighters. When they do well, their plaudits get upvoted. When they fail, a bunch of losers who can't wait to shit on a human being for having the courage to live this life come out in droves to hate on them. 

So far people are being much easier on McGregor than they were Rousey. Maybe because this was at a different weight class, maybe because Conor and Ronda talk different brands of shit, maybe because the hype hadn't reached critical mass. Who knows.
