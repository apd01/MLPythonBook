Conor is great of the sport. People love him & love to hate him. The UFC needs more guys like Conor who can hype a fight. In less than two weeks Conor and Nate managed to build a lot of tension and interest in the fight. 

There has been a lot of headline fights that come and go with little interest because the fighters don't know how to or don't want to hype their fights. Now fighters line up for McGregor because he is a one man marketing machine. Any fight with Conor is a tonne of exposure and money.
