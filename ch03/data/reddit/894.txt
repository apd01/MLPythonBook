Fight was at 170 - Conor clowned and got rocked. 

If this fight was at 155, maybe Conor doesn't get as gassed from the extra weight; let's not forget to mention he won the first round. He got caught and wobbled because he was clowning. 

Conor could absolutely challenge in 155, he just needs to actually earn it this time.
