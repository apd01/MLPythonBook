I wanna see Edgar no doubt. The talk is making that an interesting option, but I see McGregor beating him in under 3 rounds. 

And yeah, I didn't really follow Nate Diaz despite following Nick pretty often. Nick's trash talk fits my style a little more so I didn't even bother, unfortunately. That first round was easily McGregor's but watching his punches you could see a MAJOR difference in his speed and accuracy. He missed a lot of punches and wasn't recoiling nearly as quickly as he does at 145
