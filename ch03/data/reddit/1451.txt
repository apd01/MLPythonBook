The way i saw it is Conor gassed very early, it took about 1.5 rounds and he looked gassed. It has nothing to do with Nate taking his shots because he was opening Nate up good. As for giving up, the choke is in deep, he is completely gassed and probably still dazed. I mean he could've flailed about and struggled for a few seconds but what difference would it have made ?
