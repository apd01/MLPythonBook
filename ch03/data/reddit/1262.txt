Actually I kind of saw this. Nate, like Nick, has incredible endurance. Nate has been training for a triathlon. While you don't get burst speed with that training, you do get a huge gas tank at a slightly lower speed. Conor has been doing all this movement bullshit, and while it is definitely good, a car can't run only on breaks, shocks, and a suspension. Endurance beats everything.
