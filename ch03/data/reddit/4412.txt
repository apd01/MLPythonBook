I mean I don't know that he got outboxed. He got outgassed, that's for damn sure. And Diaz is a great striker and has been forever but if Conor had more gas I think it would have been a different fight. That being said, you can't knock out the Diaz brothers and they never get tired either so I suppose it could have just been a matter of time. That perfectly placed hook, tho.
