I dont care how rocked Conor was, shooting should have been the LAST thing that ever crossed his mind in any conceivable situation in that fight. Would have stood a punchers chance at the very least if he would have stayed up a bit longer and risked getting put to sleep. Hindsight is always 20/20 and i wasnt the one who just got smashed across the jaw but...still. I cant understand where anywhere in his mind would have told him that was a good idea.
