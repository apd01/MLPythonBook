People hate on the guy for being cocky, but he's generally a good fighter and he's only cocky to sell fights and to entertain. His fights are always hype as fuck becuase he's hyped them up. He racks up the attendance and the audiences and he gets everybody talking about him and the fights. He is an entertainer, and he's a pretty good fighter to boot.
