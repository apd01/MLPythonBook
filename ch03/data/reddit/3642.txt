I thought that was an amazing fight and they both did very well. I think Conor might have beaten RDA but Nate's lack of holes in his standup and his defensive boxing were always going to present a challenge for Conor and he obviously more dangerous on the ground.

Great show. I'd love to see the fans appreciate both fighters. Make your snidey comments and act all smug for a few days but lets be real. Neither were embarrassed and they both looked great.
