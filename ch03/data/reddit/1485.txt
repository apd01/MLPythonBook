I'm as xxxHardfuckingcoreXxx as the rest, but we bitch about fighter pay then we bitch about casuals. We can't have it both ways. Half the people in the sub openly admit to pirating ppvs, the sport cannot survive without casuals. If we want better fighter pay and to legitimize the sport in the eyes of the public, we NEED casual fans.
