i dont like either guy. But Conor talked a lot of shit to a guy taking a fight on 11 days notice. the kind of shit talk you can't do especially when you are gifted figthts the way conor has been. calling nate and his team mates a bunch of bums? Any of those guys would handle Conor. especially Jake Shields who took a direct shot of Hendo's H-Bomb and didn't go out.

Conor goes beyond talking and just trash talks out his ass, disrespectful as fuck.  Nate talks a lot of shit and 50% of the time it makes no sense why hes angry towards lets say, RDA or Josh Thompson who beat his ass.
