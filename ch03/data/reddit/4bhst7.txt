He looks great, he says he feels great, it looks like his natural weight. I don't think he's gonna be knocking people out like he was at 145, but that left hand is still a monster at 170. Nate just has a chin made of diamond, don't let all that blood and scar tissue fool you lol\n\nConor at 170 would probably result in much longer fights. I'm sure Conor at 155 would be exciting. I've heard people say Conor can take a punch, but I partially disagree with that. He can definitely take a punch at 145. That's undisputed. But he takes A LOT of punches. By the time he's 30 his chin is gonna be made of glass if he keeps getting hit the way he does. They aren't jabs either. A chad mendes right hook would probably kill me in 1 shot. Conor brushed it off, but there's no way he can keep it up for long. Mark my words, his next loss will be by TKO or KO. \n\nIt's pretty amazing how if you hype a fighter enough, they start to look invincible. \n\nEDIT: Ah yes, I forgot the golden rule of not getting down voted.

If you actually believe that Conor will still have the chin he has at the age of 27 when he's 30, you're out of your fucking mind. \"It's only 3 years though!\" Yea, 3 years of getting punched in the head as hard as possible. Kicked to the body as hard as possible. Wanna know why it hurts so much when you get hit in the head really hard? Because you're not suppose to be doing that. Your body is screaming \"WTF ARE YOU DOING DUDE! STOP!!!!!!\" And when he turns 40? It's over. He's gonna be getting knocked out like Liddell. You'll be BEGGING for him to retire. Just like Silva, just like Mir, just like liddell, just like franklin, just like WHOEVER AGES like a normal human being. I love Conor. I love the moments he has created for me and my friends.
