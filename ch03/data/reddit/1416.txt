If a fighter is very high in weight they have to actually start cutting weight in fight camp. Like actual fat weight by eating less and expending more calories. This is done until they are only 10~15lbs over their weigh in weight.

Now if the fighter is around 10~15lb over their weigh in weight, then they can just wait till the last week and start ramping up their water intake, which leads to more urinating. Some even wait till the last couple days for hot tub method which is more extreme but show cased well by Ronda.
