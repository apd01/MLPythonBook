I wasn't knocking Nate.  The Diaz Bros are my favorite fighters to watch.  Was just making an observation.  Another observation is that willingly going to ground against a Diaz is suicide.  You may as well just tap.  I had to go back and watch Nick's fight against Gomi after.

Mark Hunt is a beast though.  He's got cement in his hands.
