Conor couldn't get into his head. Diaz just doesn't give a fuck. Can't lose the pre-game mental warfare. On the other hand I think Nate got into Conor's head with the belt, juice, and trainer comments. Plus, Nate had nothing to lose and Conor had all the reputation on the line behind his "marketing" trash talk.
