Nate Diaz said he probably wouldn't of taken a punch with a full camp.  

lol yeah right.  The Diaz bros aren't known for their speed or elusiveness.  They both have a great chin too.  McGaygay was much faster but he got too cocky thinking he could just eat punches all day.  I'm only disappointed in the fact that Diaz didn't pull of the KO.
