He absolutely can handle 155. 

He was winning this fight til he got cracked. And that was against the tallest/longest 155er in the top 15 with the best chin in the sport. It's reactionary ninsense to say that being defeated means he would lose to RDA or other lightweights. For all we know most other 155ers wouldn't have bwwn able to eat those shots that nate did.
