No it most definitely got exposed, you could've had full tank of gas McGregor and Diaz would still have choked him out. 

I'm not saying it's a particularly bad thing, if he can continue winning fights on the feet it's great and entertaining to watch, but if he wants to step up in weight and fight some legit killers he's gonna need to round out certain aspects of his game and not drop his hands vs people who are naturally bigger guys.. Or anyone, really
