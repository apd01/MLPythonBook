Conner feels like 80% skill and 20% mind games. The first round he portrayed that skill and once he cut him I think he thought he was just gonna walk away with it and tried to put on some kinda flashy show. Even when he got rocked it seem like while he was wobbling around like it didn't phase him. Great job by Nate, hope to see Connor back, this should ground him.
