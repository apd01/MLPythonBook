Well there are quite a few good fighters still in the division, like Dos Santos, Werdum, Velazquez, Hunt, Overeem, Browne... but the fights tend to be plodding and not very "spectacular" if you will.

A few classic heavyweight fights you should check out: Mir v Nogueira, Dos Santos v Velazquez 1 and 2, Lesnar v Herring, Overeem v Lesnar, Couture v Sylvia. Those are the first to come to mind, hopefully other fans can fill out the list.
