I feel the same. I've enjoyed every since McGregor fight, including this one, but this has been the only one where I rooted against him. I'm very happy for Diaz, but also happy to see where Connor will go from here.

I think he needs to defend his belt, then take a proper shot at 155. I'd still love to see him hold both belts.
