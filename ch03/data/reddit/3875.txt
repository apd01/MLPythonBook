I don't often jump up and down at midnight yelling "oh my fucking God" at the top of my lungs, but tonight was an exception. My heart still is pounding. Up until the last few seconds I still expected Conor to end it at any moment.

And add to that Meisha's victory...

Shit and to think they gave me 20% off for this fight.
