im not losing faith, i just think he acted differently this time around, I fell in love with conor for the confidence, the smooth talking, and that crazy high pitched laugh he does. He just seemed like an asshole this time, made it less about himself and more about jabs towards nate. Compare his RDA presser to the Diaz one, he was wearing a wild shirt calling himself el chapo and all that, to diaz, making fun of him for teaching kids ju jitsu, he just seemed out of character
