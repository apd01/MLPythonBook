I get that, but against Nate Diaz? This guys a fucking legit black belt in BJJ and the only problem with his ground game is his lack of takedowns and his pure focus on countering his opponent's grappling. So why would you purposely takedown and attempt to slow down the pace against someone who's only flaw with grappling is his lack of takedown skills?
