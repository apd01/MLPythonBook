I've been here a long time and always appreciated that. I work Saturday nights and often don't get to watch PPVs until Sunday. R/videos and r/sports spoiled the results for this fight and some others in the past for me and it really takes a lot of the fun and excitement out of things. I don't see why they also act like it's crazy when people ask for things to be spoiler tagged either. This is one of biggest fights of the year. I don't see how it's any different from Star Wars spoilers, or Fallout 4 spoilers, etc. They would be pissed if people spoiled those for them but somehow they can't grasp how a huge fight being spoiled is a problem.
