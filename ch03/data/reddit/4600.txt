Don't try to take this Victory away from Diaz. Conor got beat, plain and simple. Just like he beat Aldo. This is fighting you win and you lose. Nate was the better fighter tonight. 

> This fight was lost because Connor was fucking around too much with his guard down.

Bullshit. This fight was lost because McGregor got out boxed and out wrestled. He didn't respect Diaz on the feet or his chin. Sure he made Diaz miss some punches, but Diaz made Conor miss quite a few as well. You make it sound like it wasn't so much as a Diaz win, but it was just a Conor loss. Like it wasn't the fact that Diaz went in there landed his jab, a couple nice lefts and then some slick BJJ. No it was all because Conor magically beat himself. Fuck that, he got beat, it doesn't make him a bad fighter. Conor just has holes in his game, real holes and if he learns from this loss and plugs those holes he'll be one of the greatest to ever do this. Hell just look at GSP even he got beat, came back and retired as one of the greatest ever.
