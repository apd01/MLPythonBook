That first punch that got him in the chin. Connor was a goner after that. He looked lost and got hit 4 more times right after.After that he tried to go to the cage and last it out there, he got hit a few more times. Finally he decided going to the ground would be his best option. Pretty good decision making, but that one hit just destroyed him, fight was lost after that.
