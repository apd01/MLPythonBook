Very true. It was silly to think that Mac could fight legit at 170 when guys cut a ton to get to that weight class. Either way, good on both fighters for taking the fight and it was a blast to watch!! McGregor will he back and he has his belt. It is a humble defeat and he took it well. As Diaz won lmao
