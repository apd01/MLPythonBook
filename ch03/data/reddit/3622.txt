Nate also fights 155 while Conor fights at 145 so there's still only 1 weight class differential. I'd usually agree with you but Conor cuts down to 145 from 170, then gains maybe 10-15 pounds the next day before fighting in the featherweight division(Compare the Conor at weign-ins in both Chad Mendes and Jose Aldo to the day of the fight pictures) so it's not as if his opponents didn't face the same kind of difference every fight. This is just the first time where he hasn't been the bigger fighter in the ring.
