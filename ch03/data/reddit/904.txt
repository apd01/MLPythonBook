What lol. Conor had a full training camp against 10 days no studying or real preparation like Diaz. Yeah he was a bigger fighter but I don't think the things that made nate win would change at all in McGregors favor

-nates reach and size
-nates chin
-nates ground game 
-nate can stand with him fine 
And then
-diaz has a full camp, knows conors style and what to expect
-Conor was prepared for a fight, sure it was different but he got what he wanted, someone to stand with him
-nate is a 155 naturally, sure nates weight will be different but nates only difference will be a little less weight but more prepared, idk if McGregor will find success at 155 but he certainly could but I don't think he dominates , and if not he will starve himself at 145 for a long time 
So how he Conor beat him?
