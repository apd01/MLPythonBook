Doubt McGregor is dead over this. He didn't lose his title and he's likely still gonna end up getting the title shot that he wanted regardless of this fight.

The argument could be easily made that:

1. He didn't need to take this fight at all.

2. The fight was way way outside of his weight class.

3. The fight had no meaning whatsoever in the grand scheme of things.

Not a McGregor defender here, but this is a totally different situation than Rousey.
