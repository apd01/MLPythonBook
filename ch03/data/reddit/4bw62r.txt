The first time was the morning after (spoiler free) and then the next day.\n\nRewatching it now, Conor threw a lot more leg kicks than what I can remember, and his pace is not as wild as I thought.

There's no way a top fighter would gass just throwing that volume.\n\nWhen I watched the first for the first time I thought Nate was getting murdered, but watching it now, especially during the first round, Conor got tagged a lot more than what I can remember. There were the classic 1-2 jabs from Nate, which as we know, they can hurt a lot.

He was tagged and hurt, and you can see his face and mouth getting serious, tired, mouth open, after Nate landed those combinations.\n\nFinally, Conor attacked his legs a lot. The reality is that he is not that good doing that. He didn't attack his body that much, but Nate leans with his head, so his body is very far back. ",

He does more road work and is one of the few fighters that train and spar with legit professional boxers in preparation for MMA fights.

One way to hand him that collision in a wrapped gift box is to run into it with a take down or powerful strike. This is the same strategy that kept Anderson a champion for 7 years, the only fighter he fought during his reign with a lick of traditional boxing knowledge was Vitor. Everyone else (until the Weidman debacle) had a strategy of haymakers or wrapping him in a clinch or take down. The few who opted out of that strategy ended up in boring non-fights. But when you watch Silva fight Nick Diaz, Nick makes it (hilariously) clear in the first round that he understands the game of collision baiting, and the result is a rusty welterweight standing and trading with the best striker in MMA on steroids for 5 rounds without ever being in any danger of being finished. \n\nConor rang Nate's bell a few times with the aforementioned left hand, but Nate is a great boxer who knows to always move *away* from punches until he's completely broken down his opponent's cardio. Nate also has great timing, and doesn't participate in the \"dance\" that fighters do where they take turns engaging and breathing. His cardio allows him to strike at his own tempo while his opponents' timing is regulated to their breathing. In the 2nd round, Conor was suffocating while Nate put more weight and distance into his shots, which never even had to leave the rudimentary 1-2. \n\nIf Conor spends his camp for a rematch learning how to box better, I can't help but think that UFC 200 will be very humiliating for him. He's not going to acquire the lifetime of boxing experience and aerobic ability that Nate has inside a training camp. If I were his coach, I'd tell him to not take the fight, and if he did, I'd get him walking around at 190 and send him to Tiger MT in Bangkok. At least he'll come back being comfortable destroying Nate's legs for 5 minutes straight so he stands a chance at decision. But I'm not his coach, and I'm fairly certain that his coach knows a lot more about him than I do, so this is an armchair assessment.\n\nTL;DR\n\nConor, a one dimensional fighter with a lethal combination of deep mind games and a vicious left hand, fought a good boxer with nothing to lose.

    "body": "He has good points but this gave me a chuckle. Conor didn't gas because of the little volume he threw but by putting a ton of power into the shots he threw. He was also dodging Nates strikes with exaggerated movements. There is a reason boxers dodge by a hair's length (to conserve energy). The wild kicks he threw also sapped his energy. For each capoiera kick he threw, he could of thrown 5 teeps to the body. His oblique kicks were working and then he stopped and going for the big left. Nate also had a ton of sneaky one twos in the first. These accumulate till they wobble you. Conor has all the tools to win this rematch if he follows the Diaz strategy to a tee.
