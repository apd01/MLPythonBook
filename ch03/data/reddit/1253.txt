Conor went up to 170 in two weeks to make the fight though, I don't think its realistic to expect him to know how to handle his body/energy and regulate it efficiently to fight an opponent like Diaz who is experienced at that weight. Despite Diaz not getting a full camp I think the weight advantage is fucking huge and its something people seem to be underestimating. Watch the post match press conference Diaz is fucked up and despite what the pseudo-MMAexperts are saying its clear that Mcgregor was winning that fight in terms of damage and if he knew his limits better than he would come home with a victory.

Mcgregor will be back, never doubt the persistence of the Irish.
