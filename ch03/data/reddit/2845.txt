Great fight by Diaz. Started to get nervous in the 1st round but seeing him keep his chin up proved to be very exciting later on.

For Conor, hopefully he see's this as a stepping stone. Props for him for moving up to two weight classes in 11 days. But this just shows that in the MMA you can never underestimate your opponent. 

But now its time to jump on the Diaz hypetrain, MOTHAF*****S
