Here is how I look at this fight: Conor learned his lesson. He learned that he can't take these risks anymore. He did something that no one else in modern mma would even consider for a moment. I expect we will now see a McGregor more weary of taking short notice opponents, and a McGregor who no longer speaks of welterweight. Nate Diaz. I expect we just saw the next lightweight champ. Conor will go down and fight (knockout) Edgar. Diaz will fight RDA. I am happy for Diaz, I am sad for Conor. He could have said no when RDA pulled. Anyone else would have.
