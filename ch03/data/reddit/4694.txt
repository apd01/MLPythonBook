After rewatching this Conor clearly game in way too heavy and that is why he lost. In the first round nothing Nate was throwing landed, he was clearly faster and moving out of the way. After throwing 3 spinning kicks and grappling on the fence, Conor got gassed and then he got rocked. 

I am a McGregor fan but not really sad about this loss. Even Michael Jordan had bad games. I think Diaz benefited more from the short schedule than McGregor. Diaz style is a great match up for him and the fight ended up pretty much exactly how I thought, even the submission.
