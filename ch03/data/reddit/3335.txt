Thoughts on tonight:

Conor couldn't just stay in his lane. He got drunk off of the power of visualizations, positive mindset, winning philosophy, etc. and got too cocky. He was surrounded by Yes Men in his camp including enabler Ido Portal. His main focus became the money, something which he had never experienced in abundance before, and he became drunk off of the promotion of the events. He made decisions based on what sounded the best on paper, not what reality was or what was correct. Had Conor have been more patient, stayed in his own lane, he could have done everything he imagined in due time. As is usually the curse when raw talent and gifted ability are paired with youth, Conor became impatient and careless. He will learn a lesson from this and become a stronger and better person.
