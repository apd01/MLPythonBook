a few things about the diaz bros. 1) they pretty much lose every first round, so don't get to excited 2) they pretty much bleed when the wind blows too hard 3) don't ever ever smile and think you want to start a brawl with them and trade shots, bad idea and all the sudden those pitter patters are smashing your skull in.
