I immediately felt like the way he was fighting he was bound to get tagged. Diaz bros throw a lot of volume, so betting his defense on being elusive was a really bad idea.

I felt like it was obvious that he shouldnt have been doing that. If you go into a fight its common sense to assume you might get hit at some point, even if its random. Who do you think u are, fucking Neo?
