He got TKOd by a fucking gnarly headkick that would have probably knocked unconscious almost every LW ever. He was rocked as fuck but still carried on trying to fight. Didn't work out. Corner threw in the towel at the same time as the ref stopped it. Was insane to watch Diaz try and fight through what was most likely a major concussion though.
