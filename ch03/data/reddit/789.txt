What's the next blockbuster fight for Conor?  Whatever it is, it probably won't even be as big as this fight, let alone a St Pierre, Lawlor, Hendricks, or even McDonald or Condit. Bottom line is that there are more options at welterweight.  They aren't stupid, that's why he was trying to make the jump.
