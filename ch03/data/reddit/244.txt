When will people realize he does it to sell fights? He always respects his rivals after the fights.  Him and Diaz both showed each other respect. Both said they did well in the fight. I mean he even said it himself. Humble in victory and defeat. The only answer he owes anyone was answered in the ring.  I look forward to his next fight.
