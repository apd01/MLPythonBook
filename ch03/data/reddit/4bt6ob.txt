Fightmetric scored the round for Gus because of a takedown.\n\nIn round 2 and 3 Jones scored more in total by a significant amount of legkicks (5 vs 24). Gus had more total headstikes, but barely( 9 vs 5 and 14 vs 11) Fight metric scored the rounds a draw. \n\nRound 4 significant strikes were 26-27 Jones. fightmetric scored the round for Jones by having more headstikes (15 vs 18) and by having more takedown attempts (not completed takedowns). Technically Gus had better significant strike accuracy since Fight metric score hims 100% in round 4. \n\nRound 5 fight metric scored strikes as even but gave Jones the round based on takedown.\n\nWhat im telling you is total strikes didn't matter to the fight metric in how they scored the fight. And that fight metric scored the fight 2 rounds to 1 for Jones, giving the fight to jones based on a takedown in Round 5.\n\nJust posting what you did as an \"end all\" to discussion doesn't even reflect the actual judging where you got the numbers from (fightmetric). Fights are scored by rounds, not totals. Fightmetric didn't score the fight for jones based on total strikes, i jsut addressed this for you.  ^^\n\nAnd yes.... head strikes weigh more in the Unified rules for judging criteria than leg kicks. Its in the criteria for judging.
