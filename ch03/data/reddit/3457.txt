I know Conor's persona is annoying to some but you have to respect this guy. Took a fight way above his weight and even above the weight he walks around. Got beat, stayed in the ring for an interview when most leave. Came to the post fight presser and admits he panicked when Diaz took his shots. So many super stars in the UFC run off and his after losing. Respect to Conor.
