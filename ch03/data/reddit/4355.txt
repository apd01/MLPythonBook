lol people wanted McGregor to lose so bad. Everyone who knows MMA knew this was a huge risk for him. I knew his power punches wouldn't affect someone of that size. He's an idiot for standing with his hands down and exchanging with someone naturally bigger than him. He had round 1 and started feeling himself too much. I hope he just stays in 155/145 divisions. Although I do love him taking risks like that because no one else will!
