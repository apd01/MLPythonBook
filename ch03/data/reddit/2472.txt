Lot of people missing this. After that punch, it was over. He was nearly out on his feet, badly rocked and not recovering.

I'd also add that his range was way off the entire fight - his big lefts, which he threw repeatedly early on, almost all hit air just in front of Diaz' face. It wasn't like Diaz had great head movement either, I think Conor just didn't have enough experience fighting a bigger longer man and wasn't able to adapt and the air punches gassed him.
