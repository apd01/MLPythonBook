A buddy of mine got me into MMA recently. I've been working in a sports bar for six years and only really started enjoying MMA since Dillashaw won the belt. (I think that was the fight where I was like "Holy shit! This is fucking awesome!!") Anyway, when McGregor got choked out, I could hear a bunch of people screaming "AND NEW!!" and even in my novice fandom of MMA I wanted to smack them for not knowing what the fuck they were talking about. I can only imagine how you felt when your friend said that to you.
