If you have been a true fight fan for at least 5+ years, this shouldn't be TOO shocking. Diaz brothers are beloved by MMA fans for a reason; their chins are legitimately solid and they always come to fight. But I think this fight dispels the constructed notion that weight classes don't matter. They fucking do. Most of those lefts by Conor would've slept lighter fighters. Granted Diaz bros have chins like no other, but I hope this puts to rest the belief that Conor could dismantle Robbie.
