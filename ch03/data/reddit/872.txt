Why isn't Nate champion level?  It's pretty clear to me that his fight against RDA was a real eye opener and that he went back to the training board and really started to work hard.

Hell he checked kicks in the Michael Johnson fight.  A Diaz brother checking kicks is definitely championship level.
You are underestimating a Diaz brother.  Conor Mcgregor just made the same mistake.
