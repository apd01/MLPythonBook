Conor is a natural lightweight, not a featherweight, and that last night as Rogan rightly put it 'was two lightweights fighting without a water cut'. 

Rafael dos Anjos is 5"9. GSP is only 1" taller at 5.10". Conor was fighting guys that he was a 3-4 inches taller over before. For example Mendes is 5.6"

 I think Conor now needs to go back to featherweight, and start defending his title, or get inline in the lightweight division.
