I know that there is a ton of Connor hate going on in the sub and thats fair.  When someone talks shit like he does it is to be expected, but the dude is selling fights. Plain and simple. He isnt an asshole in real life nor is Chael Sonnen in the same regard.  He was gracious in defeat and we will all be watching his next fight.
