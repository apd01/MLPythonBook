Well yeah there's probably a lot of people that've never been KO'd, but Diaz is known for being able to take a lot of damage. Conor even said himself at the post fight conference that he underestimated the power required to take out some of the bigger 170 fighters, because the shots he was hitting Diaz with wpuld normally put others out and that he started to panic a bit.
