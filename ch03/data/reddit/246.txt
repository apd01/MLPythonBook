McGregor knows exactly what he is doing, and it works. Look at how popular he has become. He talks all the shit in the world before the fight, but gives respect to his opponent whether he wins or loses. The thing is even though he lost that fight he still has his title belt and made a lot of money, so it was a win-win for him.
