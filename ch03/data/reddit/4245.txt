Hooray! I landed in Heathrow last week, a waiter spotted that I was Irish and proceeded to bore the arse off me about this tool.

He's a fuckwit. He represents the worst of Ireland and my only hope is that he becomes irrelevant again in the next few months. 

He's a knacker (urban dictionary for my international friends) and most Irish people with a shred of common sense hope that he gets put away permanently.
