Another part of it now is: Can McGregor take shots from the heavier class? It really didn't take too many big shots to wobble him. Diaz definitely has a better jaw than most, but can McGregor handle those shots himself? Can he even win on the ground against bigger dudes? This fight seemed to show some of his weaknesses if he plans to move up. 

I really love watching him fight, so I hope this was just one bad fight. I'd love to see him win another belt at heavier weight and hear more shit talking. Guess his next fight will be even more important to his career path in UFC.
