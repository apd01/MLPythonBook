Well Conor's wasn't completely wrong w/ his prediction, he did say "they all turn into panic wrestlers" and he sure as shit went into "panic mode" and shot for a takedown on a BJJ black belt, which prolly isn't the smartest thing to do but I guess it beats getting KTFO and Conor was right about to get KO'd if he didn't give up his back b/c Nate got him w/ two hard shots on the ground that immediately made Conor turn away and basically give up the choke.
