keeping your hands up has never been in boxing textbooks. that shit didnt start until the gloves got bigger and tyson popularized the peekaboo style that cus damato taught. boxing defense has always left your hands free to counter. you couldnt rely on sticking your hands up and hoping for the best with the smaller gloves. defense was based on positioning, footwork and deflections with the shoulders. conor used classic boxing techniques. he didnt lose because he kept his hands down. he lost because he gassed out and shot on a bjj back belt.
