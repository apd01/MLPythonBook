After Nate took several of Conor's punches... You could see the confidence from McGregor slipping away. People always say knockout artists lose confidence when they can't knock a guy out... I think we saw that in Conor tonight.

Also, he wasn't using any kicks and just throwing the left hand and simple one two's over and over again. Was being very predictable.
