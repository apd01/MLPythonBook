Funny thing is when this excuse was used on Mendes (which I truly believe was a HUGE factor), people were laughed at... I'm not saying that's what you are doing specifically, just saying people underestimate how bad (due to weight or schedule) cardio management can truly destroy a fighter. I agree with you, it clearly had an impact on Conor, but the weird thing is the impact would've been the same at 155. He didn't bulk up for this fight, he bulked up for RDA.
