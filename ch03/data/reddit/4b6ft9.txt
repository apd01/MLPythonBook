I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mercy that stopped him trying to do more damage when he knew the bell was imminent, and I see no reason to believe that. It&#39;s not like he has a history of doing that, and the fact that he kept celebrating after he was repeatedly told the fight wasn&#39;t over tells me one thing - the celebrating was trying to convince the ref, NOT out of genuine confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Silva is a super cool guy, but let&#39;s not pretend he&#39;s above that sort of gamesmanship. In fact I&#39;d say it&#39;s a hallmark of his career in MMA - he&#39;s won a lot of fights in his career by clowning around, making the judges think he&#39;s winning and the the opponent think he needs to do damage.</p>\n</div>",

Alternatively a TKO is when the referee jumps into the fray to stop the fight and protect one of the fighters despite both men being standing. \n\nIn MMA it's a bit more grey between KO and TKO because hitting the canvas is not a stop in action. Generally speaking, if a fighter goes limp or unconscious from a punch it's a KO and if he is awake but being beat up its a TKO. This particular finish blurs the line even more because Mir was saved by the ref but his damage came from a single punch.

Mir faked the same head dip three times in a row, which means he was looking for a strike when he should have been on the defensive. Terrible gameplan. You beat opponents you can't get a read on or figure out by dragging them into deep water. Not a smart move from a veteran like Mir.
