I keep telling people, weight classes exist for a reason. And people think Conor would be able to take Robbie Lawler punches? Comon people, size was a huge difference in this fight. Diaz had the length and probably felt stronger punches from people at 155 and 170 who are stronger and bigger than Conor.
