Brendam Schaub said size def mattered in this fight but I dont see it. I think Conor did great standing up where I thought size really mattered. Does it matter that much on the ground? Was it a factor in Conor being mounted? Seemed like he got mounted from that desperate td attempt. Once on top, how would being a few inches taller matter? Can anyone explain this? (Genuine question)
