It's weird how the times change so fast. Realizing that Anderson was fighting when Rich Franklin, Matt Serra, Matt Hughes, Randy Couture, Chuck Liddell, etc were household names that you knew you'd be seeing that year.

Now, those guys in that era seems so long ago, but Anderson Silva is a middleground into contemporary MMA, and now the competition is so fierce and fresh and young. Man. What a sport.
