> Conor has been fighting way under weight. That was a fair fight, both of them went in at their normal weights. That's how fights should be.

The problem is Conor lost his reach advantage, and that's why he got lit up. In the lower weight divisions he was always had a size advantage. But fuck, I feel bad for him. He took on a challenge he wasn't ready for.
