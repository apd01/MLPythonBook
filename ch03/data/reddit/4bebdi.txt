So, really anyone arguing that roids make the sport more dangerous are just talking out their ass when they are saying it makes people super hulks. There is no proof.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of scientific studies showing the benefits of steroids, especially Testosterone and the safety of its supplemental use for men.\n\n There are also plenty of studies that show head injure leads to lasting hormone issues. It would be foolish to consider that taking head trauma is not going to affect hormone regulation and production. It clearly does, its a  fact not my opinion.\n\nIgnoring all that, the safest standard would be to outlaw headstrikes totally if people are truly concerned for fighter heath. It is a clear and known scientific fact that repeated head trauma causes lasting and permanent injury. So, where is all the concern for fighter safety? Head trauma and the effect have been rigorously studied, its practically unavoidable and is clearly more devastating to the majority of fighters than steroids, yet here we all are.... cheering for dudes to get their brains scrambled, and the regulating bodies saying its \"a-ok\" no problem here. the loudest pops of the night from the crowd will be directly related to the guy taking the most brain trauma, a dude straight getting flatlined getts people going crazy..... until the guy is out cold for an extended time. Then, he is off to the hospital and forgotten about until the next time, people just acting like it was all good. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying I care. I'm not a hypocrite to act like I really care about fighter safety while I'm watching people eat robbie lawler punches.\n\nI'm just basically saying, the war on steroids is misguided, flawed and no necessarily in the best interest of the fighters, particularly when so much medicine can be used for recovery and healing in a sport where people are taking damage to their body.It is directly linked to the failed war on drugs. \n\nIt's worth considering that maybe we are going about all this the wrong way. It's also worth considering that we are moving, quickly, into a world where hormone supplements will seem primitive. Genetic modification, surgery, stem cell use etc etc is already a reality.
