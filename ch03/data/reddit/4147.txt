Reminds me of Adrian Broner going up all that weight to fight Maidana.. The longer the fight goes on the more it favors the naturally bigger fighter, in most cases.
Mistake taking a fight with such a big jump in weight... thought his team was smarter than that. Conor is simply too lil all be it a great fighter.
