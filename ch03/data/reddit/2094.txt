Not a Conor fan at all but no way in hell he was fighting cocky. He was fighting like he always fights (back and forth movement, range control, counter-striking) except this time he was fighting an opponent with a better chin, quicker jabs, and longer reach than he'd ever fought before. Watch the fight again if you can and notice how many punches he slipped or just outright avoided. You don't have to be cocky to get Stockton Slapped.
