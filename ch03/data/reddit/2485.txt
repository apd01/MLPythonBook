Say what you want about McGregor's antics in the build up to this fight and his strategy during it, but I have to give him credit for being willing to take risks like he does. This is the type of thing fight fans wanted to see out of GSP for his entire career and never did. This won't be the last time we see McGregor do something like this, and for that I am thankful because it makes the UFC so much more exciting.
