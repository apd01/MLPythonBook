Jesus. I just got back home from working late, had a friendly discussion with a McGregor backer about how I think he's acting overconfident going up two weight divisions against a long striker with scary ground. "But his footwork is too good...Conor is going to take him in the first minute!"
"Dude, seriously. Diaz isn't a featherweight, he isn't going to get one-punched like the other guys Conor has sniped. And if he gets desperate and goes to the ground, Diaz is one of the best sub artists I've seen."
"First round, mark my words."
Marked. Murked. Done.
