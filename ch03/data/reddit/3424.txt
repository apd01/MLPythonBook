Let's be fair here. I'm not an avid Conor fan(You can check my reddit history, i've been trying to piss off his obnoxious fanbase for months now). However, you have to admit the guy is a ridiculous striker. The same goes for Jon Jones, however his wrestling is also elite, his Bjj is ridiculous and his mental toughness is unreal(See Vitor Belford fight for proof there). Conor doesn't have good ground game and it's super well known, his wrestling is also kinda mediocre. The two aren't really that similar.
