Take his word for what you will, but I believe he has been trying to put on weight, and it shows. </p>\n\n<p>Nate, on the other hand, said he actually lost weight in Mexico after getting &quot;sick&quot; (more likely referring to food poisoning) to come down to this weight. </p>\n\n<p>So not only is Conor moving up to Nate&#39;s more natural weight, but he has less time to have his body adjust to all the mass he gained. </p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, Dominic Cruz said the same thing, and all the other pundits (including Edgar) seemed to agree. Not only that, but all of those fighters also agreed that Conor was moving up in weight. </p>\n\n<p>You can believe all the BS being regurgitated around here, or Rogan&#39;s remark which wasn&#39;t meant to be taken absolutely seriously. But I will take the word of Cruz and all those other fighters any day. Also go back to all the threads showing Conor&#39;s gains from 155-&gt;170. No one was saying &quot;Conor looks the same. That&#39;s just his walking weight.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I specifically remember the thread about how jacked his thighs got. The guy put on a LOT of muscle. Anyone who denies that is just regurgitating shit. </p>\n</div>",
