you mean like the shit talking that Ali did that brought in fans? shit talking brings attention from media and exposure, people want to see what is going on and may become fans. Women's MMA had almost no attention until Ronda did some intentional shit talking to get attention (she said exactly this in an interview, that there was no "bad guy" and it was ignored") 

it pisses off purists but it expands the casual interest who may become more serious fans. IMO no attention is bad attention  its all good
