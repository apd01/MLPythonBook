I said when this fight was announced that Connor had the better skills on paper (striking anyway), but going up TWO weight classes and taking on a legit, tough, veteran WW??

Not really surprised Diaz won this at all.  Diaz should run with this a and get some $ fights. I don't see him being the champ at WW as the division stands now, but he shows once again he ALWAYS comes to fight, be aggressive, and show legit skill.

Connor has some really, really good striking, but if he's not doing 145 anymore, he needs to stick around at 155, and stop messing around at welterweight.
