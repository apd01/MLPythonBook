For every weight class, there's a champion. For instance, we just saw Miesha Tate take the bantamweight belt from Holly Holm. 

Conor is the champ at 145, featherweight. He is (was) super cocky and wanted to make a run for a belt at a higher weight class and that's what the Dos Anjos fight would have been (at lightweight - meaning Conor would go from 145 to 155 lbs). However Dos Anjos broke his foot and was pulled out. He was replaced by Diaz (#5 lightweight) at an even higher weight class (welterweight, 170). While the fight took place at 170, this really was a lightweight battle where neither guy was forced to cut weight (a standard practice). Because this fight was outside the featherweight class where Conor is champ, he will remain the champ for featherweights. As long as Diaz doesn't try going down to 145 :P
