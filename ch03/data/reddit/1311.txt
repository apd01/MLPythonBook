Bulking up, eating and gaining weight he ended up weighing 168 for the fight. He looked way too thick for his frame, I honestly don't believe he walks around 177. He looked like someone who just bulked not like someone who didn't do a weight cut, but its an opinion so there's a possibility i could be wrong.
