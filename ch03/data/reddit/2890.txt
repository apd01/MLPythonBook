If you pay attention to what each fighter said in their post fight interview you will notice their fight strategy. McGregor said he didn't manage his energy well, and that he was ineficcient, while Nate said he started slow because he had no camp, but then started to get better rythm during the fight.

To me, McGregor's plan was to KO Nate during the first 2 rounds, while Nate's was to hold his ground until he could get going. Nate's was sucessful. 

I think if McGregor don't K.O. people early, he will end up losing. That's why Aldo rushing up to him was such a bad move. It also makes sense with his trash talking attitude, making people want to rush you down and coming at you, so you can land a big counterhit, otherwise McGregor would have to fight slow and probably gas out.
