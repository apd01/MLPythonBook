the "moved up 2 weight classes" is a bad excuse for conor. him and nate walk around at pretty much the same weight.. conor just cuts stupid amounts of weight normally so he can beat much smaller opponents (all of his ufc wins were against opponents who had much shorter reach than him, and only 1 of his wins was against a taller opponent). the size disadvantage is a bad excuse, dos anjos is the same height as conor with the same leg reach, and has shorter arm reach.. yet he managed to dominate the lightweight division defeating solid opponents including donald cerrone (twice), ben henderson, champion anthony pettis, and ofcourse nate diaz.
