McGregor is like Jones for me. I honestly don't think he's that good, he's just good. But he compensates it a lot with reach and height vs smaller opponents, and that's when he seems to be more than he actually is. Now he fought someone his "on size", even a little taller and larger reach. 

A good example of what I'm saying was Jones vs Gustafsson. 

Let's see how Aldo will deal with Diaz, and if the one-punch-knockout after rushing like a retarded on McGregor was just a silly mistake or he really isn't that big of a deal anymore.
