> they pretty much lose every first round

I don't know if they're doing it intentionally, but they basically let themselves get hit so the other guy starts throwing higher volume.

They efficiently strike back with those little pitter patter punches that people entirely misjudge.  They're not single-hit-KO shots, so people don't avoid them like they should.

They think they're landing a lot of damage on the Diaz (which they kind of are) and they think they're not really taking too much damage back.  So they keep exchanging and then find themselves asleep.

The punch that ended it for Conor was basically a kung fu double punch.  A left hook hidden behind a pitter patter backhand.  Effing brilliant.
