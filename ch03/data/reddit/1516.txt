Fair-weather fans are just as bad in my opinion.

I'm fan of Conor as well - I picked him to beat Aldo (obviously not in the way he did though) and am a little sad that he lost even though I was rooting for Nate.

New fans are what will make this sport grow and I think as long as they don't act like they have it all figured out they should be welcomed with open arms.
