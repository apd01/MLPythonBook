I stopped caring about belts when they gave Gus a shot off of a loss, when they gave Chael a shot off of a loss, when Hendo never got his rematch, etc. \n\n200 is only an important event because Zuffa told you it is, otherwise, it's a number and if they assigned numbers to all of their events like they used to, it would be UFC 371 for fucks sake, so let's stop attaching importance to things that don't matter.\n\nYou like Nate so much? Well Nate would to get paid way more for fighting Conor than he would fighting Rafael Dos Anjos, so if Nate is a genuine concern, you want him fighting Conor. You know how many people will buy Diaz vs Dos Anjos 2? Maybe, MAYBE half of what Conor vs. Nate's gonna do.\n\nFavoritism is why Nate gets this awesome opportunity to get champ-like recognition without actually having to be the champ.\n\nI like Frankie. He lost 3 title shots in a row though at featherweight already. (EDIT: meant to just say he lost 3 title fights) I want him to succeed but I want this to play out first. Conor got his ass beat and he wants revenge, that's what I want to see. He doesn't have to be wearing some shiny shit for me to get up for it. \n\nNate wants the biggest fight, Conor is the biggest fight.\n\n",
