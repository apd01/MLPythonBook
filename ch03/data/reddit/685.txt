This fight has made me a sports fan for the first time in my life. I don't really watch UFC but I watched last week's Anderson/Bisping fight and now this one. I was very aware of all the hype around Connor Mcgregor and that made me think Nate wasn't gonna stand a chance. When Connor started looking dizzy, my heart started racing and when he tapped out, I screamed so hard with excitement that I woke up everybody in the house.
