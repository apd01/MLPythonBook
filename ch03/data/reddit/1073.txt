I don't think Dana is going to allow Conor to fight at Welterweight again. And especially against the greatest WW of all time. He hasn't earned that, and if Nate...who didn't cut to get to the weight was too much for him, imagine the hyper-athletic GSP who walks around at 200. Steamroll right over him. Conor is the best Featherweight. He should stay there. No shame in that.
