People paying for PPV is good for the sport. Money is good for the sport. UFC doesn't give a shit about Aldo because he can't sell a ticket -- the PPV buy numbers don't lie. 

The bottom line is if people aren't going to pay then athletes won't go pro or go to boxing, promoters will do other things, and the MMA scene will be a stale place. Money matters. 

Also, I think you really underestimate Conor. He had a 15 fight win streak -- he didn't win that by running his mouth, no matter how easy those fights might of been. That hit on Aldo wasn't lucky, that was Aldo showing how shit he is at boxing. He was dominate because no one could check his aggression, Conor checked his aggression.

Diaz wasnt a stupid idiot like Aldo. He boxed, took his hits, established his game, and waited for his spot. Conor was the idiot and started to clown because he wasn't winning like he thought he would and got put down.
