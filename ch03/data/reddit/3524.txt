Look how Nate slaps his head into the lock.

No one was listening when I kept saying Nate was getting the best of Conor before the fight. He really got into Conor's head. Or more accurately, Conor got frustrated he could not psyche out Nate. Conor would go on the whole dialog and then Nate would say two or three words and piss off Conor.
