Few have been tested, and many of the natural pesticides that have been tested have been shown to be carcinogenic.  Whether or not a pesticide is &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;synthetic&quot; has zero relevance to whether it&#39;s safe at levels found in food.  Many natural pesticides already found in plants or used in organic farming <a href=\"http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/03/myth-busting-are-synthetic-pesticides-used-with-some-gmos-more-dangerous-than-natural-ones/\">are more dangerous</a> than synthetic pesticides.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10854122\">Glyphosate</a> (Roundup) is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798302\">not</a> dangerous to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22683395\">humans</a>, as many <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202229\">reviews</a> have shown.  Even a review by the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/ph_ps/pro/eva/existing/list1_glyphosate_en.pdf\">European Union (PDF)</a> agrees that Roundup poses no potential threat to humans.  Furthermore, both glyphosate and AMPA, its degradation product, are considered to be <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912208\">much more toxicologically and environmentally <em>benign</em></a> than most of the herbicides replaced by glyphosate.  </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "\nThe United States government forced Monsanto and several other companies to manufacture Agent Orange in the Vietnam war using [Defense Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Production_Act).\n\n>President Kennedy approved spraying various mixtures that include 2,4,5-T, another powerful herbicide, 2,4-D, and other chemicals on the jungles of Vietnam. As U.S. involvement in Vietnam increased, so did the defoliation efforts. Agent Orange, consisting of equal parts of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, was introduced in 1965. Several chemical companies were compelled to provide the Army with Agent Orange under the Defense Production Act (Glasser 1986, 514). By the time its use ended in 1970, 11.2 million gallons had been sprayed over about 10 percent of South Vietnam\u2019s land area. \n\n>Potential dangers of herbicide toxicity in general and of Agent Orange in particular had been known by Army officials for some time. Monsanto, one of the largest producers of Agent Orange, informed army officials that 2,4,5-T was a toxic substance as early as 1952. A 1963 Army review of toxicity studies of 2,4,5-T concluded that there was an increased risk of chloracne (a severe but often treatable skin condition) and respiratory irritations, and that the risk was heightened when the chemical was applied in high concentrations by inexperienced personnel.\n\nhttp://www.perc.org/articles/government-recalcitrance\n\nAnd shown more in the Supreme Court case HERCULES INCORPORATED, et al., PETITIONERS v. UNITED STATES, both the [majority decision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-818.ZO.html) and the [dissent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-818.ZD.html).\n\nIn fact, Monsanto even warned the government that the manufacturing processed demanded by the government was contaminated with dioxin and thus dangerous, but the government didn't do anything.\n\n>Internal memoranda revealed that Monsanto (a major manufacturer of 2,4,5-T) had informed the U.S. government in 1952 that its 2,4,5-T was contaminated.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange#Chemical_description_and_toxicology\n\n\nIf you want to be mad at the industrial chemical side of Monsanto, be mad at Pfizer, who now owns that segment of Monsanto.  The Monsanto of today is not the same company that did all that damage decades ago.\n\n>Through a series of transactions, the Monsanto that existed from 1901 to 2000 and the current Monsanto are legally two distinct corporations. Although they share the same name and corporate headquarters, many of the same executives and other employees, and responsibility for liabilities arising out of activities in the industrial chemical business, the agricultural chemicals business is the only segment carried forward from the pre-1997 Monsanto Company to the current Monsanto Company.

As U.S. involvement in Vietnam increased, so did the defoliation efforts. Agent Orange, consisting of equal parts of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, was introduced in 1965. Several chemical companies were compelled to provide the Army with Agent Orange under the Defense Production Act (Glasser 1986, 514). By the time its use ended in 1970, 11.2 million gallons had been sprayed over about 10 percent of South Vietnam\u2019s land area. </p>\n\n<p>Potential dangers of herbicide toxicity in general and of Agent Orange in particular had been known by Army officials for some time. Monsanto, one of the largest producers of Agent Orange, informed army officials that 2,4,5-T was a toxic substance as early as 1952. A 1963 Army review of toxicity studies of 2,4,5-T concluded that there was an increased risk of chloracne (a severe but often treatable skin condition) and respiratory irritations, and that the risk was heightened when the chemical was applied in high concentrations by inexperienced personnel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.perc.org/articles/government-recalcitrance\">http://www.perc.org/articles/government-recalcitrance</a></p>\n\n<p>And shown more in the Supreme Court case HERCULES INCORPORATED, et al., PETITIONERS v.
