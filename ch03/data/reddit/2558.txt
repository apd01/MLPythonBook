This is the funny thing. It happens in a lot of fighting sports, and happened very recently in Boxing with Anthony Joshua. A guy comes in, wrecks the scene with easy wins and everybody jumps on their shit (I love Conor, i think he's awesome, by the way). In none of those fights were they really tested. Yes, maybe that's because they are so good that the fight is usually over before they get a big one to the jawbone, but you can't sit back and expect your man to comfortably beat everybody when he hasn't het been properly lamped in the face.

Luckily when AJ got hit hard he kept his head and pulled through and still won, so i wasn't too heartbroken by it. Unfortunately Conor seems to have no idea how to handle taking a big shot from a guy used to fighting heavier guys than him and once that landed the fight was over. I did not see Conor ever coming back from that.
