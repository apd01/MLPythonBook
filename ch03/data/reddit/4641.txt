I'm a neutral in the sense that I'm as much of a Diaz fan as a fan of Conor, and I actually think Conors analysis was spot on. He came out blazing in that first round, and he fought at a totally different weight class. More muscle costs more energy. He won the first round (imo, and yes Nate did say he intentionally had a slow start), but it also expended much of his gas tank. On top of that, when Nate started landing more shots in the second round, every shot drained Conor even more.

Not trying to take anything away from AWESME Nate Diaz, but obviously nobody (including Conor) knew what a huge factor this whole energy thingy would be.

I'd like to see this fight again where both have full camps!
