I wonder how many Conor fans bail. 

It was a great fight. I love both guys, even if I wanted Conor to win and indeed thought he would. Having just re-watched the fight, he's right in saying he would do better conserving energy so that his performance in the first round isn't limited to just one round.

I'd love to see a rematch down the line. Aldo II should be next.
