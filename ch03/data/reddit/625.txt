I think the thing a lot of people were forgetting is that Nate almost always ends up busted up. I think he's just got a fuck load of scar tissue or something because it seems like he always bleeds.

The blood might have left mcgregor thinking he was doing more damage than he was. I don't think he was used to or expecting someone to be able to trade with him power wise.

At least he fought ten day diaz instead of full camp rda.
