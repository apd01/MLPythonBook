Huh? I'm fully giving Diaz his due. He got McGregor to roll over with simple punching. That's the kind of shit you used to see ages ago where a guy would get mount, throw a punch to one side and get the guy on the bottom to roll  away from contact right into the submission.

Diaz handled him like it was rookie night at the gym.
