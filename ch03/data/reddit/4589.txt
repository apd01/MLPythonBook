The most overrated fighter of all time got destroyed when he faced a real fighter. No fighting midgets this time. Diaz got into his head and absolutely outclassed him. McGregor quit when it got hard, typical kid trying to act tough from Ireland I guess, don't mess with someone from Stockton. 209 ALL DAY
