Not even fair... Lawler would have Mcgregor drinking through a straw for the rest of his life if he attempted to go the distance... but I think we've finally proven that Conner is clearly better suited as a 170 pounder fighting at 145. 

If Conner wants to become champion again, he needs to cut weight again. Clearly his walking weight is too hard unless he wants to fight Holly.
