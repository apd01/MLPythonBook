Conor fan here... Also a bjj brown belt who lives in the USA and is from Scotland/Ireland. Conor has some of the best stand up in the game, but his ground game is abysmal. I understand this problem, we have no wrestling or bjj pedigree. We are raised on boxing and boxing alone. 

It was great to see conor take this defeat with dignity, I sincerely hope that he takes the loss as a lesson learned. He was submitted by a world class gracie black belt. As a millionaire champ, He needs to take the next 6 months to a year and find the best BJJ school he can, train 9 hours a day and drill hard like a mother fucker.

Lord knows every single one of his opponents watched this and now has the game plan of taking him to the ground. We all knew this was his weakness.

Ditch the Ido Portal bullshit. Hire a high level bjj black belt and Train like a motherfucker. If w as a millionaire champ, that's what i would do. C'mon conor. Learn from your mistakes.
