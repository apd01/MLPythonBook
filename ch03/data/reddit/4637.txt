I get you. There's the excuse brigade coming out in force. I'm just saying Diaz made it look easy once he got it on the ground. I thought that's how he would have the shot at winning but I didn't expect it to be so simple. 

He didn't even bother with that potential Kimura. He went right into the top position, put his right arm in position and then popped McGregor's head clear with the left hand punch.

As I said, you used to see guys slip right into the submission when the ground game was still a mystery to many. But to see a top guy make so many mistakes on the ground is eye-raising. It's got me jacked like I haven't felt in ages to see a guy get handled like that.
