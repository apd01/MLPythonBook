Nate Diaz was very good money tonight. Going up 2 weight classes like Conor did, smart bettors were taking Diaz and got the W. I know J-Lau was taking Diaz, threw $50 on him at +380 and profit

 I wanted Conor to win first but when everything seems like you get such good odds like that gotta go with the smart $$ and see what happens. And I'm not gonna go against Lauzon dude is a genius. Knows what he is talking about.
