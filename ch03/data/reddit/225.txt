Why? He fought like three weightclasses up in a nothing match? So he can't beat a guy 3 times his size. He bloodied Nate up pretty bad though. Full credit to him for not going gently into that good night.

He'll just go back down to 145 and knockout Edgar before getting a rematch for the 155 title. No skin off his back.
