Different circumstances. Tates choke was fightable until it wasn't plus I'm pretty sure Holms air punches at the end were a last moment of conscience effort to tap. Nates choke on the other hand was sunk in from the start, nothing to do but tap or wait 2-3 seconds until you go black. People tap in this moment. You would tap in this moment.
