The UFC and its fighters are at a crossroads. 2014 hurt them bad. 2015 was dope. 2016 is on pace to out do 2014 in injury fuck ups. You can't build a business on fight cards that may happen. You always know the super bowl or World Series is going to happen when they say it will. You can't build a successful HW division if the champion fights 3 dudes in 6 years or something like that. With the fox deal coming up and the elephant in the room of chord cutting, this type of thing cannot happen on a regular basis going forward, or else fans will begin to fatigue. \n\nIf jones Cormier is delayed due to injury, then 2016 is a lost year for the UFC cuz all the 2015 momentum will be gone by UFC 200. And can anyone really get hyped for 200 right now? You can't get hyped until the week of the fight and that is going to keep the sport from ever making it to day in day sport center talking heads level. \n\nSo, has any champion fought 4 times a year? No. Can they? I think yes. If magny can fight 6 times a year and then keep that pace the next year, how come others fight 2 times a year tops? Are they training too hard? Maybe they should train less so they can fight more. There is a race for the sharpest edge, but that often comes at the detriment of the fighters' long term health/success. You can't win if they other guy put it all on the line for this one fight. Same for weight cutting. I'm sure plenty would like to avoid it, but can't cuz they know the opponent will cut. So both fighters put their bodies through unhealthy stress that is only necessary when both fighters have implicitly agreed to do so. So the UFC needs to start making rules to force the fighters to fight more while simultaneously ramping up medical clearances and making it harder to be sanctioned for a fight. Sanction independently from commissions. If the fighters then continue with current strength and conditioning regimes, they will be injured too much and will be punished by the new system that rewards activity. The fighters that take the nick and Nate Diaz approach to fitness get rewarded and we start to see fighters more often per year, thus improving their visibility, thus making them more household names. As it stands, seeing a dude show up from who knows where once, twice a year means fans don't really get to engage. \n\nAll in all I think the UFC needs more of a season, without the league. Make winning 3 or 4 fights in quick succession against top 15 ranked fighters as celebrated and rewarded as beating the top ranked fighter and then having to take 6 months off due to injuries. ",
