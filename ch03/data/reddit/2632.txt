uh....uh......shit.............I didn't know there would be a test......fuck.........Conor McGregor went into that fight way too cocky and while he did take a risk, he was completely out of his depth and paid the price for it. Like damn he tapped almost immediately. C'mon Conor you know your grappling game is shit, so why did you try and take it to the ground? The only one he can blame for that loss is himself.
