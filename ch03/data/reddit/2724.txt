> actually he looked pretty good till he got ROCKED on the chin in the second round.

Even before that moment, he was often staying in with his hands down and his head still after he threw his punches.  The whole fight, Nate had been landing some good shots in response.  Conor didn't seem to care and he didn't adjust.  Seemed only concerned with his offense.  And then it started happening before he threw his punches, too.  He spent some time just hanging out in punching range, taking some good shots at times.  And he still didn't seem like he cared.

Yes, he was winning before that shot landed in the second.  But I thought he looked a bit wild and sloppy on offense at times, and was often very careless about getting hit in return.  The strikes on him were starting to add up.  He couldn't have taken the shots over 5 rounds, and would have HAD to finish Nate before he got finished himself.

And that's a BAD way to fight a Diaz.
