There was a voting system in place in the past, but we would like to limit any possible chances of favoritism in the exchange of quality.\n\nWhen we pick our top 10, I will write a comment in the thread of who moved on to the finals. Soon after, a new thread will be created announcing the winner.\n\nThere are no rules as to how you decide to edit your video. All the footage just has to come from the download link I attached below.\n\nOur featured fighter for this month's contest is rising MMA star Angela Lee. Angela has made quite the splash in WMMA since her debut with us back in May 2015. Since then she has gone on a 5 fight undefeated win-streak with all 5 victories coming by submission. She trains at the famed Evolve academy in Singapore and is expected to be one of the next big things in WMMA, as she was just recently nominated at the World MMA Awards for best female fighter of the year.\n\n\n***This contest started late in the month this time, so I'm having it run from now until April 8. (12 AM EST)\n\n\nMake an awesome video for Angela and set yourself up for the next $500 prize! \n\n\nAttached here is the download link to the footage. I included interview, fight footage as well as training clips. So you'll have a lot to work with here:    \n\nhttps://onefcbovongsakoun.sharefile.com/share?cmd=d&id=se058b325ec94ec79#/view/se058b325ec94ec79?_k=kkdqsf\n\nSecondary link in lower video size, in case anyone has issues downloading the above one: https://onefcbovongsakoun.sharefile.com/d-s9d5bbf0d2b945a1a\n\n\nCheers,\n\nFlyWin\n\n",

This is a cool tutorial to get started off with the basics on that software. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhBeziSa6-E\n\nI started off originally in imovie and miraculously made some of my best old school highlights on there. But eventually you need to graduate to a higher quality program. If Premiere doesn't work for you then Final Cut is another great alternative.\n\nA good strategy that I can suggest is starting off by mapping out the video in your timeline. This is most effective by starting off with putting all interview soundbites in order so that you have the story you're trying to tell all down and ready.\n\nOnce it makes sense, then start adding the clips to it as well as the music. Finding a strong audio track is also something that will be sure to make your video standout. However, without the editing it doesn't go too far.\n\nFor color correction I would suggest trying to get Magic Bullet Looks as it offers a wide range of color filters. As well, search on youtube for some lens flares and film burn transitions that you can overlay over your footage to make it a bit fancier and give it a more professional feel. \n\nHope any of that helps!\n\n",
