I think anyone who's ever boxed/sparred before will know that your ability to take a punch is hugely diminished once you become fatigued.

Conor thought he could see off Diaz early, and threw a lot at him, not accounting for how his power might not translate to 170lbs against a naturally bigger guy.

Conor was the one expending himself, Diaz took a lot of punishment but he wasn't really expending himself. He's a triathlete as well so he still had a lot left in the tank if he managed to ride out the storm, which is precisely what he did and he seized his chance.

Once Conor tired his overconfidence really came back to haunt him and it was reckless to fight that way, and not get the finish.

Your ability to take a punch once you're fatigued is hugely diminished, believe me, I speak from experience.

Might not have seemed that way initially, but I think Diaz actually fought a really smart fight.
