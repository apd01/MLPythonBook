I'm not even sure the rematch goes the same way. Conor was doing his thing until he started getting worried and tried clowning to open up Diaz. Conor just needed to trust is boxing would eventually win out (not that it would, but clowning against Diaz was obviously a big mistake) -- or maybe he knew he didn't have the conditioning to box all 5 rounds. 

I hope they both go on a win streak and meet in a title fight. That shit would by hype. Nate being the only guy to beat him but in an exhibition fight. Now with a belt on the line, how will people react.
