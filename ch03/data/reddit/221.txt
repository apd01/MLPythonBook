You couldn't pick a better quote to throw back in his face. This is *exactly* what happened.

Before the fight, I said Nate would be stupid not to take this fight to the ground - and Nate *is* stupid, so he probably won't. The theory was that Conor hadn't proven he could win a fight on the ground. It was stupid to try to stand with Conor where he's proven he wins fights.

Nate technically won on the ground, but *I* was wrong. Make no mistake: Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor standing up, trading punches. He got the shit punched out of his face and hung in. Conor couldn't hang. Conor got rocked and got desperate. Nate closed the deal.

Nate won this fight as cleanly as a fight can be won. Kudos.
