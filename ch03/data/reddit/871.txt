Dont see how Nate beats rda tbh. Southpaw leg kickers are already his worst nightmare, when you add wrestling and excellent top control it just looks really hard for him. 

Rda even won the slapping contest when they fought haha.

But yea, lawler vs nate is insane, wouldnt surprise me if they scheduled it tho, cashing in on Nate's win over Conor i guess.
