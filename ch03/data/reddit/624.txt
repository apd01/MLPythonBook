Yes. Conor tagged Nate repeatedly with punches that rock and/or knock out fighters at 145. Nate got busted up by them, but not enough to lose. Not enough to stagger.

Nate won this fight standing up. Conor tried to escape on the ground, and Nate ended it.

For the record, I am speaking as someone who expected Conor to win. All praise to Diaz.
