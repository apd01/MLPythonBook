I feel like we all knew going in Connor isn't good on the ground. The desperation shoot to buy time was a fatal error, but one that needed to be made.

The funny thing I saw was people shitting on Connor for tapping when Holly didn't tap. That's a mistake on Holly's part. You should always tap. It's fucking stupid not to tap, that's how people end up in the hospital. Know your limits, it's rule #1.
