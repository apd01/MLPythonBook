1) the diaz brothers have insane cardio. people who say they have good cardio even top level fighters they are a notch above.

2) they both have this high volume range finding and baiting punching style that has a hidden little point....

3) when diaz bros are doing all those light  jabs that have low power behind them are annoying and opponent's start to feel they can walk through them or ignore them for a chance to land one. then 1 out of 10 (totally made up number) get some power behind them and if this is the one that catches you its like wtf. 

4) nate is an amazing counter puncher and defender against strikes.
