I'm just here for the memes to rub in my friends faces. I was the only one out of 14 people who even considered this could go to Diaz. Nobody thought he would even make it out of the first round. I saw some people saying they made a lot of money. I am in that money boat as well. Great event. Huge upsets. Couldn't be happier. But for real... Where the memes at?
