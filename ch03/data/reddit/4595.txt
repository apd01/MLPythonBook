I've seen this comment a bunch of times and I cant help but get triggered. Tapping is the way to go if you got no way out. Getting choked out because of pride is not the way to go.

Especially when it comes to armbars. I DESPISE motherfuckers who don't tap and force an opponent to break some guys arm, like Nog did vs Mir, Miesha vs Ronda or Hardy vs GSP. If you get caught, you tap.
