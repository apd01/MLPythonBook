I just rewatched the fight with no sound, in slow motion, and noticed some VERY interesting things that run contradictory to what I thought I saw on first viewing. I started slow motion just before the punch that rocked McGregor. Prior to this moment, it was pretty clear McGregor was winning the fight. Not only the first round, but the beginning of the second as well. 

What was really surprising was just how few of Nate's shots actually landed, after the shot that rocked Conor ("The One"). Watching them in normal speed, with all the commentary, it looked like everything Nate threw after The One connected. However, if you watch in slow motion with no sound, you can see that most of these shots (I would guess something like more than 95% just by rough estimate) are either all dodged by McGregor, missed by Nate, or are glancing shots. I was very surprised because I thought Nate was connecting on everything he threw on my first viewing. 

The only real shots Nate landed after The One, were after Conor shot, and Nate was in top position. He landed two VERY hard shots on Conor's chin. Those probably did the most damage after The One. 

Other things that surprised me: there are so many more Stockton slaps in this fight than one could imagine. You think it's like 3-5, but it's really 10+. Even Conor throws one or two in there, one of them being a stockton fake with the right, and followed up with a left. 

I also thought Conor's movement was poor in the first on first viewing, but on second viewing it didn't look like that. It just looked like Conor kept going for a KO. 

Biggest shots landed looked to be by McGregor, but Nate just ate them up. It's insane. That guy has an iron chin. Nate's biggest shot was definitely the one that wobbled McG on his legs. And ever since that one, it was all downhill (but not with as many connections as you would think. Conor's head movement after that shot was excellent in slow motion).
