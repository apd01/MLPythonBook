Am aware, I've heard his walk around weight being as high as 175-178 but if that was really walking around weight I think he would have been closer to the 170 mark eating 2 breakfasts and whatever the fuck else. How long do they wait to start actually cutting? Was he mid-cut when RDA pulled and then fight gets switched to 170? Not really sure about the specifics on that, am looking for info not trying to hug his nuts like most here would accuse me of.
