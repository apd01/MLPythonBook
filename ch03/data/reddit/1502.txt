I have zero problem with having someone to root for and I totally agree.

The issue I take is that a new fan, with literally zero knowledge of the sport was trying to act like he knew everything about the game and the fighters despite never seeing any of their fights.

Like after the Aldo loss, saying that he knew that knockout would happen when he didn't even know who Aldo was three months prior.

It was just ridiculous.
