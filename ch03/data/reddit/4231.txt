Connor can clearly hit hard but boy he cannot stand pain. He was wobbly in a couple of shots and shot and gave up the mount so easily and two hits on the floor he rolled right into an rnc. The biggest downfall of this fight will be that he isn't a tuff guy and taps out easy. Compare it to gus, Rory, lawler or a ton of other fighters. Yeah not so tough
