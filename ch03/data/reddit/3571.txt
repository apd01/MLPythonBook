I mean, Conor was BANGING Nate up. Got a little too confident, dropped his hands, threw some show-off kicks, got tired, and Diaz started tagging him with the same 1-2 that he nailed Johnson with so many times. It wasn't a dominant victory from Nate by any stretch, I'd love to see this fight again at 155 with full camps. I love the Diaz bros, and I love Conor, and Conor was outboxing Nate, who is one of the best. Diaz got beat up but proved once again that he is raw and downright impossible to put away. It was a fun bout, and as fans we are losing big time if we never see a 155 rematch.
