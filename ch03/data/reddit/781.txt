Dana was probably happy with Holm losing. Holm's fights in the UFC have all been boring. She's an absolutly boring fighter and needs to be carried by the opponent to make it interesting. If the opponent sits there and doesnt pressure the action: you get rounds 1 3 4 where nothing really happens.

Sure, the Rousey fight was great, Rousey pressured the action nonstop right into Holm's plan..
