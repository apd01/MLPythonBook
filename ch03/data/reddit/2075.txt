McGregor hype is nowhere near the end. He has to go back and find himself again, let all that fake hyped persona el chapo shit wear off and find the true fighter that we know again. At least that's what i hope for. 

I kinda feel like this is the best thing that could have happen to conor. He got a wake up stockton slap,  a reality check in a fight without his belt on the line.
