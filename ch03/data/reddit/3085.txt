He just hasn't fought someone with a complete game. We saw him get tagged up by Mendes in a similar way, but mendes couldn't finish it after getting gassed from not having time to prep for the fight. Had mendes been the original opp, that fight would have ended similarly. The Aldo fight still blows my mind, Aldo got rattled and after being on top so long should have known how to deal with it.
