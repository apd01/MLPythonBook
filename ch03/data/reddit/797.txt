Really? I mean going into the fight, I believe it was pretty close. After the first round I felt Conor was gonna handle it (like Vegas, majority of MMA pundits, and my group of ass-hole friends at the bar believed). But that second round he looked gassed and Nate seized the opportunity.

When you, as an adult with free will, type "Well...I ain't surprised MOTHER FUCKER!!!" it leads me to believe that you have been waiting months to type this message. It leads me to believe that after Conor KO'd Jose, you went into your garage and screamed into a pillow so that your friends/family wouldn't hear you and you promised that once he finally got stopped that you would undercut the first person you saw on Reddit that expressed general confusion at his loss. 

Nate Diaz is raw and a force at 170. Anyone who doubts that is delusional. But think for one moment: Conor is 2 weight classes above where he has been fighting for his past fights. How lucky are we that we saw them fight at all? 

I may be still tipsy from the fight and I may have been rooting for Conor, but I will be damned if I let some half assed/fanboy comment get by in this subreddit! 

But at the same time... WAR 209! And praise the great lords that gave us this fight!
