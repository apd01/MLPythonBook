Aldo should learn a thing or two from Nate. I'm not always a fan of all the stuff the Diaz brothers say, but I am entertained most of the time AND you can't doubt their toughness in the octagon.

Nate took the fight. Aldo may have been injured and not cleared or whatever, but he REALLY shouldn't be talking now.
