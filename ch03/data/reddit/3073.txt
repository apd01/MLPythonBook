/r/mma is predictably tripping over themselves to bury Conor, but I respect the hell out of him for even taking this fight. Moves up in weight, his opponent pulls out two weeks before the fight, and he goes, "Sure, I'll fight someone else who fights a completely different style."

Most champions would have been too concerned with protecting their reputation/ marketing power. Conor wants to fight everyone. That's an attitude we should celebrate.
