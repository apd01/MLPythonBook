First time fighting another southpaw with a longer reach.  McGregor has enjoyed a reach and size advantage in his other fights.  

It's interesting when guys who typically have reach advantages fight against someone with a similar or longer reach.  Jones got busted up by Gustafsson, Klitchko looked like shit against Fury, McGregor's whole range game went out the window against Diaz.  It's a big adjustment.
