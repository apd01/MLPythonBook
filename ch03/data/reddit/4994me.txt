It's going to be near impossible to catch up to Nate and beat him in his own game, and clearly McGregor couldn't win with the style he has right now.  Nate is too tough to KO for him, and volume fighting is where Nate is best.  McGregor won't be able to become an elite wrestler or pass him in grappling/jiu jitsu either.  But if you can picture a way Conor beats him let me know because he didn't outbox Nate.  Nate's game is to slip and if he fails get hit and survive, throw volume and wear you out.  Sure McGregor landed a lot and did more damage, won round 1, but all these people saying he outboxed Nate are so off - Nate outboxed Conor and won because of it.

I think for jumping up two weight classes in ~3 months, Connor did well last night. Maybe Connor&#39;s boxing wasn&#39;t legendary, but he did pretty well against a guy who many say has some of the best boxing in MMA (my untrained eye gave the first round to Connor). I mean, until he started getting slapped around haha</p>\n</div>",

He hurt Diaz, was winning the fight, and tried to Anderson Silva him. THAT was a mistake. Taking this fight was not a mistake. He fought even though his opponent pulled out. He put on a great show against a bigger guy and didn&#39;t try to weaken him and exploit his own star power. In the long run this will gain him a lot of respect, especially if he wins a rematch. Meanwhile he got humbled and will take opponents more seriously - a lesson he had to learn on the evidence offl Sat night.</p>\n</div>",

The fight against conor showed a diaz who came in serious, healthy, and ready to rumble. And it showed, with a first round submission victory over reigning champion Rafael Dos Anjos, Nate Diaz claimed the 155 belt, and became, the UFC lightweight champion.\n\nThen McGregor did what he does best, and pissed people off. Calling out Diaz, looking for another title shot. And again, like the fight in 2016, Diaz turns the tables and tells him, \"No.\" He says, \"why don't you defend your little baby belt, and you can fight me once you earn it.\"\n\nLet me tell you, say what you want about Conor, but he went after it. A rematch against Jose Aldo Jr. ends in another first round knock out for McGregor. \n\n(Clip after fight: McGregor yelling into mic \"Why you scared Diaz?!\")\n\nDiaz shows again he's at his peak by beating Anthony Pettis in a one sided unanimous decision. \n\n(Nate: Bitch beat one grown up and maybe we'll talk)\n\nSo what does Conor do? He goes to Dana White. And DANA WHITE SAYS NO.\n\n(Dana: in 2016, we admittedly got ahead of ourselves. I think I was at fault there.

He made it his mission to show Nate Diaz that things are different now.\n\nNow. UFC 209, in MGM GRAND this Christmas. The featherweight champ. The lightweight champ.

But instead she went for the rookie suicide throw and just made it 1000x worse.</p>\n</div>",

After predicting a first round KO and not getting it, I think the urgency with which he then began head hunting in round 2 and not setting up his left hand as well as he did in round 1 is what fucked him over. Promo-Conor and Fight-Conor have always been one seamless person, but when Fight-Conor couldn't do what he predicted in promos he fucked up. And to get back to your point specifically, I think that promo persona is bigger now to Conor than his coaching, his teammates, his skills, really bigger than anything else in his game. And that's not good. His corner advice from Kavanagh was quite good but the pressure he creates in promotion has proven to be overwhelming when the fight isn't going his way. I don't think he was listening to Kavanagh because he was only thinking of getting the early KO like he predicted and not fighting the fight that was playing out in front of him. I think he could have won that fight with the advice he was getting, maybe a decision or late finish, but he sets himself up for spectacular victories and anything less would be a loss to him. So he was losing one way or another. Hopefully they'll see what played out and Kavanagh will have an easier time getting through to Conor next time a fight doesn't go perfectly.",

I put way more effort into it than I should've, hopefully it's well-written enough to keep your attention.**\n\nConor McGregor has been on an undefeated (in the UFC) hot streak of early KOs culminating in his record-setting 13 second KO of long-time champ and all time great Jose Aldo, winning him the featherweight (145 lb) belt. He was supposed to challenge the lightweight (155 lb) champ Rafael dos Anjos in an effort to be the first in UFC history to hold two belts simultaneously. There have been multi-weight champs before, but never simultaneously. \n\nUnfortunately, dos Anjos broke his foot about 10 days before the fight and had to pull out. The UFC scrambled for late replacements to keep the fight going, and Nate Diaz was chosen. Diaz being the 5th ranked lightweight who had already been destroyed by dos Anjos, and lacking the \"training camp\" fighters usually go through(usually 4-6 weeks of constant training meant to allow a fighter to hit their maximum physical potential for a short window of time), Diaz was a huge underdog, and many thought McGregor would knock him out early in the fight, as he'd famously predicted and done several times before.\n\nNow something to know about McGregor is that he's a huge trash talker, and certainly the most effective the sport has seen in terms of getting eyes on him and stirring up controversy. He was making a lot of claims about being the greatest ever, and his plans to be the first ever to be champion of three weight classes, and how he was the big money fight and everyone else was a bum in comparison and so on and so forth. Adding to this, he's very proud of his Irish heritage and has generated a huge and loyal Irish fanbase for himself and the UFC.\n\nThe Diaz brothers (Nate's older brother Nick fights in the weight class above him) are also famous trash talkers and taunters, but they mostly keep it to the cage rather than at press conferences, where they're notoriously reticent. In keeping with this, Diaz had called McGregor out after winning his last fight. McGregor really took the trash talk to another level for this fight, in terms of volume, bravado, and some would say nastiness. So there was a lot of dramatic tension built up going into it. There was an interesting dynamic between McGregor's constant talk about money and how rich he was, and Diaz's background of growing up in the extremely rough and impoverished area of Stockton with only his brother Nick to count on. This was made stranger by McGregor's working class background- some suggested he shouldn't forget where he came from.\n\nAn important thing to note is that the fight ended up taking place at welterweight (170 lbs) rather than the expected lightweight (155 lbs) because Diaz would be unable to cut down that much on such short notice. Though Diaz offered a 165 lb \"catchweight,\" a confident McGregor suggested they simply fight at welterweight. As a result, Diaz cut relatively little, and McGregor cut little to nothing. All in all, Diaz probably walked into the cage 5-10 lbs heavier, though he was carrying some fat, being out of camp.\n\nThe fight itself was a great one: McGregor was more confident than ever, walking Diaz down and winging his famous left hand with everything he could muster- and landing, quite a few times in the first round. This style had recently become the norm for McGregor. When he landed that left hand, and he always did, whoever it hit would usually go down. If they didn't, he only had to crack them a few more times, and that was that. Of his seven fights in the UFC, six of his opponents were KOed within two rounds. His ability to predict KOs and deliver on them seemed almost mystical, and he predicted another first round KO for Diaz, despite the Diaz brother's remarkable endurance. Many, if not most believed him, and the betting odds reflected it.\n\nSo when Diaz took his best shots flush for a round and was still fighting, it started to become clear that something was very wrong. Not only was Diaz conscious, he seemed completely unfazed, continually taunting, delivering the famous \"Stockton slap,\" a simple slap to the face meant not only to check distance but even moreso to enrage the opponent into making mistakes. Though McGregor took the first round handily, Diaz was basically unhurt but for a cut over his eyebrow and other cosmetic damage, which didn't indicate much more than a glancing blow. Worse for McGregor, Diaz was starting to find his range with the high-volume straight punches he's known for. This is significant; for the first time in his career, McGregor is fighting someone bigger than him, and crucially with longer reach.\n\nAs the second round opened, it looked almost like more of the same- McGregor headhunting, landing some hard punches. It seemed, however, that he'd lost a bit of spring in his step, and his punches and movement had maybe lost a beat due to his energy dump in round one. Though he was far from gassed, he was certainly more tired than Diaz, who is known as a cardio machine who pretty much never runs out of energy. Diaz started to open up more, landing his long, lazy 1-2s that started to frustrate McGregor and break his rythm. McGregor was unhurt by these \"pillow punches\" and continued walking through Diaz's punches, trying to trade his more powerful hits for Diaz's peppering shots, letting himself be hit. Seemingly out of nowhere (using one of his classic tactics), Diaz opened up on one of his 1-2s, catching McGregor's chin flush with a hard left straight, sending him reeling on wobbly legs. This was the first time in his career that McGregor had been rocked like this. With his opponent clearly hurt, Diaz started to swarm, continually popping him with hard jabs and straights as McGregor fought desperately to regain his wits. Diaz kept up relentless pressure, never allowing McGregor to recover, culminating in a desperate  and ineffective takedown from McGregor, whose grappling had been in serious question ever since his rapid rise to the top. Diaz, meanwhile, is known as a crafty and highly skilled submission artist. He transitioned to full mount (one of the two most dominant groundfighting positions) with ease, raining down punches on McGregor, who gave up his back and subsequently a rear naked choke to which he tapped, late in the second round.\n\nBecause of the unprecedented amount of shit-talking done by McGregor, and the passionate fans and anti-fans he inspired, he's faced a decent backlash as a result of this loss. His mystique of invincibility and KO power at any weight class is gone, and many are saying he can only be the best by cutting a ton of weight to make featherweight (145), where he is far and away the largest fighter. One of the things McGregor had been saying was that he would be the best in any weight class, that he could KO anyone from featherweight to lightweight to welterweight. This has been demonstrated to be untrue, and though it was likely just bluster to sell fights, he's been catching a lot of flack for his inflated ego and insane cockiness. Now, he's been saying things like \"I took a risk fighting a bigger man,\" which many see as a silly excuse after talking himself up so much and are dismissing him as overrated.\n\nAs always, the truth is somewhere in the middle. McGregor probably should've done a little less talking to avoid this kind of backlash, but at the same time he really did take on a huge challenge with this fight by volunteering to do it at welterweight. He'll still be a huge draw and is still a great fighter, but his mystique is gone, and he seems human once again.\n\nTL;DR: You better read that novel I just wrote, but basically- McGregor talks an epic amount of shit all the time and especially for this fight, looks like he's going to back it up again, then loses in dramatic and somewhat humiliating fashion. In the aftermath, some perceive his reaction as excuse-making and others see it as humility. Really, it's a bit of both. I highly recommend watching the fight if you can find it.\n\n",

Conor said it right off the get go. There are a lot of pussies in this game and Nate is not one of them. A lot of the shots Diaz ate in the first round would of put away a lot of fighters in opinion. Exp. at 145.\n\n-Diaz did say in the post fight interview that him training two hours a day even not being in camp is light for him. So saying he was out of shape I wouldn't buy. Like i said I am a noob but i think there are almost some pro's to not having a long full camp. But hats off to the guy for coming in there and doing what he did.\n\n-Conor is good for the sport. If you want to hate on the bandwagon folks like myself for flooding the UFC then that your choice. If you would rather have the UFC circle a small group then fine. But i think its great when a fighter can bring in a huge new audience. It's more fun having more people know about the game whether they know what there talking about or not. Getting this sport to the point where a large majority of the people are excited and talking about upcoming fights is awesome.\n\n-Conor got caught (like Aldo). People keep talking about how Nate's BJJ won it for him but i respectfully disagree. Conor got hit with a clean shot that ended the fight. It just dragged on a little longer (30 seconds) where he eventually tapped. I don't think Nate's BJJ expertise won that fight for him. Diaz reach was punishing Conor. It seemed like every solid shot Mcgregor would land Nate would be right there with a counter. \n\nThe guy i was rooting for lost. Still had a great time watching it. I have become a fan of this sport when Conor started talking all that shit to Aldo for there first scheduled fight. Since then i have been following it non-stop. Have a lot of other fighters I like now too. Conor is still my favorite and I think he handled the loss like a champion. Can't wait to learn the sport more and I hope this really accelerates things for the UFC since Boxing entertainment value is dying. \n\nJust my 2 cents. ",
