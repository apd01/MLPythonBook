DC picked up Josh Barnett (265 pound heavyweight) and [slammed him on his head](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1074010/temp-320-53005636.gif) like it was nothing and [took a punch from extremely hard hitting Rumble Johnson.](http://gfycat.com/EnragedFrenchKitty) McGregor and Diaz would not stand a chance.
