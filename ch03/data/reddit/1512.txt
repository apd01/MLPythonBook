The funniest one I saw was the website for The Mirror, a British tabloid. Every time I googled anything about the fight in the past couple of weeks they'd always be in the top results with some of the most ridiculous headlines I've read. One of them even claimed that Conor "slaughtered" Diaz at the weigh-ins.

I hate to give any traffic to that rag but I had to check it this morning to see the reaction. Lots of stories about how shocking the result was.
