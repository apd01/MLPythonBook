Nah mcg was being outclassed on his feet at that point. If McGregor didn't shoot, he would have been knocked out eventually.
He expended a lot of energy trying to ko Nate 1st round, and Nate would have just 50% punched his face all day (the Diaz brothers have been known to go 5 rounds looking like they could go 10 more).
