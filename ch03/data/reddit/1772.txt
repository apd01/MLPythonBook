Connor is the ufcs golden boy. There is no belt or title but beating the golden boy does mean something. I wouldn't be surprised if this boosts Diaz to a title shot at light weight.

Also Connor is the 145 pound champ. He moved up to 170 which is two weight classes above his fighting weight and fought a top ten fighter but not a champ in Diaz. He still is the 145 champ but his auar of invincibility is no longer there. Risky move by Connor but huge pay off. Looks like it didn't work.
