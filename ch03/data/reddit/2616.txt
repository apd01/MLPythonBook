that still doesn't negate the sheer thought of moving your hips in closed guard. if Conor was using his hips and then Mendes was recentering him and keeping him flat, i would agree with you but Conor didn't initiate anything from closed guard. even in open workouts Conor would do weird stuff during grappling sessions that were just technical errors.
