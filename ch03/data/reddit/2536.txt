I think he got Aldo'd and got emotionally invested in this in the buildup. The cold calculated swag filled Irishman I fell in love with wasnt there leading up to the fight, and he wasnt in that octagon tonight. Conor fought impulsively, and tried to brawl with a guy with longer reach, more height, and a tougher chin. At least I didnt have to watch conor get TKO'd. I dont think I could handle seeing that :(
