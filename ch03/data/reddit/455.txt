This. I hate that this was called a welterweight fight. Conor lost to a 155 that that had no training camp and neither had to go through a weight cut. If Conor fought a real 170 he would be destroyed. The way Diaz took his punches tonight shows you Lawler would walk through them like they were nothing.
