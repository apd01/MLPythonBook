I'm not sure I agree.

A loss is always pretty devastating, it's almost natural to carry on lik Ronda did after one, especially won like this. He was all class after the fight.

I suppose it is easier to fake humility after a win is more the thing, but McGregor is genuinely humble. UNLESS he is promoting a fight.
