I disagree with nate's statement of being the superior boxer. He was clearly the better wrestler, but conor also clearly dealt more damage. It was almost as if conor was simply trying to deal damage and punish him but not effective in a TKO attempt. Conor kept landing one two's and not following up, then Nate went into desperation mode and luckily caught him and capitalized on conor's lack of grappling defense. What was your take?
