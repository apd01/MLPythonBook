Give it up man. His last fight before Diaz was 145 so it is fact he went up 2 weight classes to fight. He ate some of Chads hardest punches. A full camp Chad might take him further than 2 but the end result would still be the same. His ground game is ass but his striking and movement is better than most that he will come up against so they cancel each other out to an extent. The difference is both fighters had no chance of getting out that choke hold. Tapping and doing some shadow boxing shit before you choke out doesn't mean shit they both still lost. The Mcgregor hype train was more than justified and it will no doubt continue.
