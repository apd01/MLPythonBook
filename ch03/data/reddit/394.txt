I wouldn't call that karate. He was slipping punches like a boxer and he drops his hands to get in people's heads like Anderson Silva. It's just a mind game / disrespect thing. I think his downfall was he started to not respect nates game as he was starting to connect and started bloodying up nates face. He started worrying less about defense, started moving his head less, and started focusing more on how good he was doing. The problem is the Diaz brothers have granite chins and have won so many fights in that exact fashion. You start beating them up and drop your defense in an attempt to finish the fight, and then they catch you and you're fucked.
