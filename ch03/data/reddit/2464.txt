I agree with most of that, and I like your writing, but I disagree on two fundamental points:

a) The fight was a lightweight fight really - just one where there wasn't a weight cut. This is really important to note for 2 reasons:

- 1) A real 170-pounder (think someone like Lawler or Condit) would be at least 15-20 pounds (of mostly muscle) heavier at fight time than Diaz and McGregor were there, and in many cases be taller and longer than Diaz. It's not Conor's power (and chin) doesn't translate to 170, it's that it doesn't translate as well to *155*. Actual 170 pound guys would hurt him badly in most cases. His 170 pound ambitions are done unless he can put a lot of muscle on and develop a fighting style that works as a guy who is small for the division. 

- 2) This is a huge issue for Conor as he is struggling to make 145 and is assuming he'll do really well at 155. Now Nate has a very, very good chin but this has to put serious doubt in his mind as to whether he can even thrive at 155.  Conor may have a bright future or he may be a more or less spent force now and fade rapidly as he becomes unable to cut to 145 where he has a size advantage and is just a gatekeeper at 155.

b) Nate landed quite a few solid jabs (and the famous Stockton slap) in round 1 - it wasn't as one-sided as it looked. Those jabs may not look like much but they rattle and tire the opponent and the Diaz brothers have made a career based off of them. Certainly Nate laid enough damage down in round 1 to start slowing Conor down in round 2 so that he could start landing the 1-2s that broke Conor.
