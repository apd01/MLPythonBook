I said in a thread coming up to the fight with RDA, that Conor was talking too much trash and not showing respect for other fighters and the sport itself, and that he WAS going down with a 100% probability, sooner or later. Because every single one of them goes down, at one point or another. 

And this is where being respectful for your sport and your opponents comes into play.

Conor will have to deal with a lot of shit talk now. It was coming anyway, and it was crazy of him to not expect an outcome like this. 

May he find solace in his millions of dollars.
