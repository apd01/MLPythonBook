One fight and the circle jerk goes from "Conor could take the 170 belt" to "He can't even beat the top 10 in 170"

Conor lost fair and square. That is true. But he still had the upper hand in this fight. He underestimated the power of Welterweight and you can see this by the fact that he hardly had his hands up. He treated the fight as a joke and deserved his loss.

Conor did some serious damage in that first round without going 100% and underestimating his opponent. If he genuinely tries his hardest and doesn't let his ego take over, he could definitely win fights against the WW top 10.
