Two thing I noticed: mcgregor is an amateur on the ground and he tapped fucking quickly.  Holly Holm didnt fucking tap, she was spasming. This is the difference of heart. Nate took punch after punch, didnt quit. C-man quits in a heart beat, as soon its not going his way. People talked about Connor fighting Lawler. Lmao. Even RDA should be out of the question now, its ridiculous.
