2 minutes before the choke it was obvious it was over. Connor was so dazed after that chin shot when Diaz said whats up. I can't believe how good the odds were to bet on Diaz.... Lots of money was made. I got 800:1 on Diaz to win by submission rd2. Too bad i only put $10 on that.... Put some losing bets too so only made a few k. The fight was only going to go 2 ways: conor by KO early or Diaz by submission in 2nd or 3rd. It was so clear. Great fight. Have you ever stacked on 25 pounds? No way conor competed past the 1st. He knew that. He was so gassed after the first. Done. Diaz will beat him any day of the week at that weight. Yeah Diaz got some punishment but he has the iron jaw we have all seen. Dude can throw and he can take.
