Congrats to Nate he really knows how to warm up, so dissapointed in Conor. All he had to do is hold his hands up and not be so fucking cocky and take advantage of Nate's eye and he might have won that fight, but even with that avantage Conor didn't seem to have that much energy be able to make it to 5th round at 170.

After a fight like this would love to see them fighting for that belt at 140, maybe Conor would wake the fuck up.
