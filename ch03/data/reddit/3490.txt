Aftermath for Conor isn't quite as devistating as a lot of people are predicting in this thread. Losing to a new opponent on 10 days notice 2 weight classes above where you fight isn't exactly embarassing.

He'll probably defend FW belt at UFC 200, it's not like one submission destroys his credibility.
