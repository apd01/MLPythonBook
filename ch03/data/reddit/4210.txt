What are peoples thoughts on Conor just not being strong enough? Early on he was landing a lot of punches and I was getting worried for Nate but it was like none of them phased him, none of them had enough power behind them to actually do anything. Does the weight difference actually matter that much? Because you could just look at Nate and see that he was not that fight ready despite him training for a triathlon, he wasn't firm at all and had little muscle definition. But even with that Conors punches didn't do a whole lot and Nate basically wore him down fairly quickly. It was almost weird how fast Conor wore down after getting the two times in the 2nd. He was so quick and agile and then it was like he was moving at half speed.
