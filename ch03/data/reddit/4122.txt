I think biggest thing in this fight was Nates chin. Conor busted his gas tank on that. When he had no more energy to slip he was lit up with Nates boxing. It was over when he got wobbled the first time. Against pretty much any one else below 170 those shots would have been enough. In a perfect world Conor would have utilized leg kicks more early in the fight and taken the safe route ala RDA and folks.
