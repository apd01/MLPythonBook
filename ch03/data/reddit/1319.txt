Holy shit these McGregor fans talking about McGregor being 170 blablabla... 

They're the same fucking weight, except neither of them had to dehydrate themselves 24 hours before the fight. 

People are making excuses like it was Nate Diaz who had the original fight, and McGregor stepped in, on a 11 day notice; when it was the fucking opposite.. Nate is a fucking hero!
