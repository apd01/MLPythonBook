You can still cut weight with those tests though. I still cut 25 pounds in high school just by cutting down right before the test, to a few pounds under the weight I wanted to be at and then drinking water up to weight in order to pass the hydration test. Then the test resulted in me being allowed to wrestle at that exact weight and not drop any lower (due to body fat) and I still managed to pass the hydration part. But those tests definitely are a good thing, I'm just saying if high schoolers can get around them pros definitely will.
