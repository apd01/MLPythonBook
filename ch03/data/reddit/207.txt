Nate is usually a slow starter, and Conor is usually really aggressive. Most of his punches actually hit nothing but arms and air, though he did win the first by pure aggression. Nate was just the better fighter tonight and as Conor's aggression slowly faded, he just succumbed to a more experienced and skilled boxer.
