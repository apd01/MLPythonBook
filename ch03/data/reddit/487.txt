>He took on a challenge he wasn't ready for.

He was ready for it he just didn't fight smart. He should have fought Nate like Henderson did. He destroyed Nate's front leg and his mobility which made it very hard for Nate to use his boxing. McGregor went toe to toe with the guy and traded punches, that's the worst way to fight the Diaz brothers.
