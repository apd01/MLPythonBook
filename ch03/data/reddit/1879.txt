Thank you. Yea he was being a cocky fuck before he got hit, but after that it was essentially over. For a second I thought he was able to regain composure when Diaz stood him up against the wall, but that quickly proved not true. 

He went for the takedown not because he thought he was going to be able to do anything, but in hopes that he could stall out the round. I don't get why people can't see that.
