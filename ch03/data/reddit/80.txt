That's the point - they were lining up, but Aldo was offered this fight and turned it down. Fair enough given that he got KOd pretty hard less than three months ago, but it does mean he forfeits the right to talk shit, at least for a while. Saying 'you got nowhere to run' after he just refused a fight just makes Aldo look silly.
