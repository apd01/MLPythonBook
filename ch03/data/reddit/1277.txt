He is a title challenger at that weight. He literally fought benson Henderson for the strap.

He also is coming off some really outstanding performances against Johnson and now mcg. He's absolutely catapulted himself into the contention talk once again.

He may not be the #1 contender, but to say he isn't a title challenger seems a bit silly.

Edit: reread your post, maybe you meant not a title challenger at welterweight. If so, disregard above!
