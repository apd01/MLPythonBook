thats because the core of crossfit is a lot of really good compound movements that are 100% effective and stand the test of time

and people love the teamwork/comradary atmosphere. there are thousands of crossfits gyms all over the world. just because one is run by an idiot doesnt mean crossfit itself is "bad"

comparing that to playing touch butt on the beach is ridiculous 

i get it though.. its an internet forum thing that gains karma points, to make fun of crossfit

its usually the frail gamer types, skinny fats and fat asses that are found on forums bashing crossfit, while the crossfitters are out busting their asses getting in great shape
