The key phrase is hold out to the last possible second. I've trained a bit as well, but I still believe that tapping is the smart move if there's no escaping the sub.Obviously fight it until all escapes are denied, but Nate's RNC was so tight there was no way in hell a gassed/rocked McGregor was getting out.
