That doesn't excuse his bad conditioning. Nate was fighting at a really low pace for a high level LW and McGregor was tired after 1.5 rounds. If you want to see what the pace of a fight at the top of LW can be, look at Ferguson/Barboza, the RDA/Pettis fight or either of the Alvarez/Chandler fights. Not only do you see the insane pace that many of the top guys in that division can go, they also show just how insane their ability to take enormous amounts of damage is.
