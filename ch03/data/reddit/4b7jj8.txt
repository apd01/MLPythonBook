Werdum, Cain, JDS, Overeem, Browne, Arlovski amongst many others don&#39;t. Some do sure, Hunt is a thick, strong dude but his weakness is his wrestling and he has to obviously get in range to throw. Jones has that reach which usually allows him (along with his arsenal of strikes) to keep the opponent at the end of his combos. </p>\n\n<p>Jones can be 230-235lbs at HW and do work. He is the most talented. He is still a big dude. Fedor was around that much (maybe about 235lbs), Cain and JDS don&#39;t weigh that much more and were the best. Overeem isn&#39;t big nowadays and is doing decent.</p>\n</div>",
