Agreed... I was rooting for Nate but wasn't too happy with Rd 1, McG looked damn good out there. That left was connecting at will... now granted Nate didn't have much time to prepare, but still... he slipped shots and connected hard with the left over and over... He looked good, patient, accurate.

If anything, I think Conor overestimated how easy this would be, and at the same time highly underestimated the power that guys carry at 155/170 compared to FW. But I'm excited for Conor vs RDA/Ferguson/Khabib/Pettis/Nate II etc. 155 will be good for him and for us.
