There's a difference between not having your hands up in front of your face and letting them hang loose at your side, which is what he did numerous times throughout the fight.  He was trying to taunt him and finally got tagged doing it in the second.  He then did it right after to try and show that he could take his best shot, at which point he got his bell rung and was unbalanced for the remainder.

He was using boxing techniques at the start and had the fight in the bag until he got cocky and lowered his guard, which is what lost him the fight.
