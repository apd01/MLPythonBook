I didn't bet that fight because I had no idea wtf was going to happen.

However I was really confident in this one so I bet Diaz over Conor, Diaz by Submission, and Diaz inside the Distance (odds were like +300, +500, +600). [Talked about it a bit here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/48ph4z/officialthursday_betting_discussion_thread/d0ls36c)

Totally happy.
