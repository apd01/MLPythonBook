nah, takedowns when youre stunned or gassed are common because they often give you breathing room. Its VERY common in MMA to see this work correctly, it just didnt happen here. I cant even count how many times someone was about to get KTFO and then they hit a takedown and end up regaining some stamina an clarity.
