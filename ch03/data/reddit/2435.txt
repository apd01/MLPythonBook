how are you defining "good for the sport?"

fighters need money, money comes from viewers and fans.

 fans range from hardcore fans to casual fans. Expanding the casual fan base will naturally expand the hardcore fan base but getting those casual fans in the door is the hard part. Interest has to be created because casual fans are not really interested in the technical skills but more the drama of the fight the more new viewers the more hard core fan base will expand.
