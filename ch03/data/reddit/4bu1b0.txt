    "selftext": "In the [second installment of the Fundamentals of Fighting series](http://www.omnimovement.com/omni-blog/2015/11/25/fundamentals-of-fighting-critical-distance), we introduced the concept of critical distance. An important strategic concept, critical distance is essentially the range at which a fighter wants the exchanges to occur so that he is able to maximize his offensive opportunities while minimizing his defensive risks. Critical distance is a dynamic concept that is determined by the strengths and weaknesses of each fighter. An accurate assessment of critical distance gives the fighter a strong framework to support his overall strategy. \n\nWith a sound strategy developed, the fighter must then have the tools to implement that strategy. One of the most important concepts when looking to establish critical distance is the ability to gather information. In this article, we will discuss the importance of gathering information, and the tools a fighter may use to do so in his efforts to control critical distance.\n\nTo the untrained, fighting is chaos. The variables are constantly changing and it becomes nearly impossible to keep up with them as your senses are overwhelmed. With training, you learn to control the variables. You learn that a good stance keeps you balanced and ready to attack or defend. You learn that footwork makes it more difficult for your opponent to attack you. You learn that your opponent has to react to the things that you do, and by reading his reactions you can get a step ahead of him. You learn to control the chaos. However, as you learn to manage the variables, your opponent also learns how to deceive you. The three most fundamental forms of deception in fighting are manipulation of distance, breaking of rhythm, and misdirection\u2014corresponding to the fundamentals of distance, timing and positioning. Today, we are mainly concerned with manipulation of distance. \n\nManipulation of distance is a form of deception where the opponent works to give you a false sense of how close or far away you are from them. The human eye is prone to being tricked\u2014harmless fun when trying to determine the length of a line in an optical illusion, but absolutely deadly when trying to process the exact distance your opponent is standing at. The best distance manipulators trick the opponent into focusing on their head, ignoring the rest of the body, then playing with the distance their head is at to confuse and trap the opponent. Take perhaps the most famous example of distance manipulation, the classic Mayweather pull counter:\n\nhttp://gfycat.com/BrightWarlikeLark\n\nBy leaning his head forward over his front foot, Mayweather gives his opponent the impression that he is standing much closer than he actually is. When the opponent comes forward and tries to reach his head, he pulls it back between his feet, causing the opponent\u2019s punch to fall short while inviting him to walk directly into a clean counter punch. Mayweather was able to land this exact same punch consistently throughout his career, all because he showed his opponents a false opening that they jumped on based on their misunderstanding of distance. Other fighters may do the opposite\u2014make you think they\u2019re farther away than they are, only to close distance unexpectedly. \n\nhttp://gfycat.com/FarHighlevelImpala\n\nMendes has stepped back into a southpaw stance as he retreats. He leans back as he shuffles away, luring Lentz into reaching further and coming forward faster in an attempt to find Mendes\u2019 head. However, Mendes\u2019 lead foot stays close to Lentz. When the time is right, Mendes shifts his weight over his front foot and easily ducks in on Lentz\u2019 hips, taking him down straight to side control. By starting with his head back and his stance upright, Mendes tricked Lentz into overextending despite how close he was actually getting. \n\nMore recently, Dominick Cruz put on a masterclass in deception as he forced TJ Dillashaw to swing at air for 25 minutes, making him miss nearly 300 strikes in the process. TJ, despite having developed his own spectacular movement, constantly lost track of Cruz and found his strikes coming up just a little short\u2014the same way Renan Barao\u2019s had against him previously. In the lead up to the fight, Cruz was insistent that fighters like TJ only look so dangerous against immobile targets, asking TJ \u201chow are you gonna knock me out if you can\u2019t hit me? I don\u2019t get hit\u201d. Both in the interview and in the fight, Cruz raised the key question\u2014how do you hit something when you don\u2019t know where it is? The danger there is clear. If you commit when you aren\u2019t sure of the distance, you\u2019re going to leave big openings for your opponent to capitalize on. The solution is, of course, to measure distance and gather information. \n\nFor the rest of the article (including a clip of two Omni Movement athletes demonstrating my favorite distance drill), please check out the blog at Omni Movement, where you can also find the rest of the series:\n\nhttp://www.omnimovement.com/omni-blog/2016/3/24/fundamentals-of-fighting-measuring-distance-and-gathering-information",

    "body": "Firstly, to address your comment I want to say that I see half of cruz's abilities in fighters like Anderson Silva, good head movement, but when it comes to drawing punches, he's not getting out of the way with his feet in tow. Thomposon's footwork and distance measuring is excellent but he's not going to be ducking in trying to draw punches. I don't think it's a lack of skill but a lack of belief that stops other fighters from trying to implement a cruz-style approach, fighters just don't think it works, and I think it's because it's not very well understood.\n\nI think you've miss-attributed a lack of refinement to a cruz that was present earlier in his career.  Cruz's striking and movement hasn't ever needed to improve, but I think that you're so used to the orthodox approach to game improvement that you've failed to realize that it isn't cruz's striking or movment that's improved over the years, but instead it's his ability to deceive.\n\nHere's my example: http://i.imgur.com/UZnkbRZ.gif\n\nIn this gif we have cruz attempting to use the same technique in cruz vs bowles vs cruz vs dillishaw. First of all, let's be very clear that Dillishaw is clearly a superior fighter in every aspect than Bowles was, that having been said, why then was cruz able to land an attack on TJ that made Bowles retreat? A number of factors, but mainly cruz's ability to decieve his opponents has greatly improved, now instead of backing out like Bowles did, Dillishaw stays right where cruz wants him. Cruz is pretty far removed from the rest of his division at this point, IMO. I think a good analogy here is that Cruz used to have to bait his hooks, to get fish to bite, but now he no longer does. Like in his fight with faber, you'll see cruz get rocked in the 3rd or 4th(can't remember) because at this point in his career he's still leaving his head out there to draw punches, where as now he's just fainting that, instead of actually leaving it out there.\n\n",
