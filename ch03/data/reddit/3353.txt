thats what i was saying. he was show boating and trying to show off " cmon, hit me atleast ", so nate did. after Nate rocked him he put his hands up almost as much as to say " so what now?? " and then picked him apart.

extremely disapointing to see professional fighters disrespect their opponents and the sport itself.
