what's ridiculous about it? You can try and spin it and say it's a high level fight and people have to lose etc but he really gave up in there when the going got tough. You can see how his demeanour changed after nate took his shots. It's the fact that he talks about people breaking and fighters pulling out and stuff, yet the will was sucked out of him pretty quickly. Is he still a warrior? of course.... but it's simply the fact that he talks so much about other fighters' will and his will just was visibly not there.
