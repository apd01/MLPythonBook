Hi guys!

I come from a boxing background and I enjoy watching MMA, I just don't follow it as strongly as I do for boxing.

I just have one thing I need clarification on:

I kept wondering why McGregor had his hands down a majority of the fight. I was trying to determine whether or not it was a style or him being cocky. Is that how McGregor always fights? Is that common in MMA?

I also believe I heard McGregor say that he would fight Mayweather. After what I saw tonight, I don't think it would be possible.
