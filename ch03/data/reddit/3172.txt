It was either before the Mendes fight or just after it. Might have been on one of the embedded vlogs for either UFC 189 or UFC 194. Could also have been on that 45min embedded documentary UFC put out before UFC 194 fight with Aldo. I don't remember exactly where it was but after he said it UFC marketing team made a big deal out of it saying McGregor has a do or die mentality everytime he steps inside the octagon. But clearly when someone is choking the life out you and blood to your brain is slowly getting cut off and you are left helpless at their mercy your fighting philosophy is truly tested and clearly McGregor bought into his own hype and doesn't have that mindset.
