Diaz ate about 10-15 much harder hits and kept coming. McGregor tried to do the same when he got caught with a good one but he started wobbling and it was over. 

He must have known he would be in trouble if he didn't finish it early because he was aggressive going for a knockout in the first. He even said he didn't manage his energy correctly. Stepping up that much weight that fast has consequences.
