Gracie Academy is not a very well respected system in a lot of BJJ circles now. The family is super talented, but their system has become more about profits than skill. My response was more sarcastic than anything, because a blackbelt has already proven themselves time and again, but the lower belt students in the Gracie system usually don't stack up very well.
