When Cain fought Werdum in Mexico City for the strap last year, he waited until 2 weeks(?) out from the fight to Train in Mexico City, which is at high elevation in comparison to where he usually trains in the US (at AKA in San Jose, I believe). Werdum spent his whole camp in MC training in less than desirable conditions to prepare. Cain gassed out in round 2 and got subbed.  \nTo be fair, a LOT of the fighters on that card were not prepared for the elevation and gassed or threw up post fight. It was a tough event for everybody, especially Cain. Also Cain had a significant layoff in between fights due to injury thanks to bad conditioning coaches and/or glass bones disease, so he had significant ring rust which could have also accounted for his loss. Werdum actually went into that fight the interim champ as a result. ", 
    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re joking but I&#39;ll answer honestly just in case. When Cain fought Werdum in Mexico City for the strap last year, he waited until 2 weeks(?) out from the fight to Train in Mexico City, which is at high elevation in comparison to where he usually trains in the US (at AKA in San Jose, I believe). Werdum spent his whole camp in MC training in less than desirable conditions to prepare. Cain gassed out in round 2 and got subbed.<br/>\nTo be fair, a LOT of the fighters on that card were not prepared for the elevation and gassed or threw up post fight. It was a tough event for everybody, especially Cain. Also Cain had a significant layoff in between fights due to injury thanks to bad conditioning coaches and/or glass bones disease, so he had significant ring rust which could have also accounted for his loss. Werdum actually went into that fight the interim champ as a result. </p>\n</div>",

He just needs to show up and say, \"I'm Nate, I'm the guy you only know because I kicked some other guy's ass. This is who I am...\"\n\nGuess what happens next time he has a fight? People who heard the story of Nate might think, \"that Nate-fighter-guy has a fight this weekend, we should watch it. Cheer him on with all those kids he helps in Cali\". \n\nGuess what happens with the UFC finds out that people are buying PPV or supporting UFC because of Nate? He gets the fights he wants! It is really that simple. Not being a clown for the masses, just getting out and make it know you're more than \"some ufc guy\".\n\nThe woman actually have been doing this -- I think RR put on a bit of a show, but she was the first so I don't blame her. Holly was out doing talk shows and other things and I bet some people tuned in because they got connected to her personality. Hell, I got connected to her personality. \n\n\n\n*edit* Also release that most people don't follow these people like we do, so the vast majority of PPV buyers really don't have a clue who Nate is beyond a few hilight clips of him dropping f-bombs.\n",

Most people watching that fight watched because they had heard of CM (or Holly), not because of Nate. But right now Nate is sort of a big deal. A talkshow might invite him on, or Sports News programs. </p>\n\n<p>He doesn&#39;t need to put on a show. He just needs to show up and say, &quot;I&#39;m Nate, I&#39;m the guy you only know because I kicked some other guy&#39;s ass. This is who I am...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Guess what happens next time he has a fight? People who heard the story of Nate might think, &quot;that Nate-fighter-guy has a fight this weekend, we should watch it. Cheer him on with all those kids he helps in Cali&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Guess what happens with the UFC finds out that people are buying PPV or supporting UFC because of Nate? He gets the fights he wants! It is really that simple. Not being a clown for the masses, just getting out and make it know you&#39;re more than &quot;some ufc guy&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The woman actually have been doing this -- I think RR put on a bit of a show, but she was the first so I don&#39;t blame her. Holly was out doing talk shows and other things and I bet some people tuned in because they got connected to her personality. Hell, I got connected to her personality. </p>\n\n<p><em>edit</em> Also release that most people don&#39;t follow these people like we do, so the vast majority of PPV buyers really don&#39;t have a clue who Nate is beyond a few hilight clips of him dropping f-bombs.</p>\n</div>",
