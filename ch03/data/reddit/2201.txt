Not really. As someone who has practiced Jiu Jitsu. When it comes to chokes, it's common practice to tap while sparring, but in a match or a fight you fuckin ride that shit out. You try your best to escape, and you hold out until the last possible second if you can. Especially if it's a championship match.
