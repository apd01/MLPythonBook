If he had dived on Nelson and tried to finish, Nelson probably could have woozily grabbed a hold of a leg while Hunt looked to awkwardly land hooks on a belly-down opponent (a reason that we need knees to the head of a downed opponent back). By doing his famous walk-away\u2014Hunt avoids the problem that a striker would have to deal with by jumping on a floored grappler and failing to finish. It&#39;s clever, and it looks awesome too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think that was always the reasoning considering he started doing the walk-away knock outs back in kickboxing, but there is for sure a tendency for high level grapplers and wrestlers to instinctively shoot for a single or double leg takedown when they are completely rocked.</p>\n</div>",
