I thank everyone involved for the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m completely at peace with this decision and believe it&#39;s for the best.</p>\n\n<p>While working at FOX was great, it was always a part-time job. My full-time job since 2009 has been working for MMAFighting.com. Nothing has changed there. The MMA Hour will air on Monday, The MMA Beat tomorrow ... all status quo. I humbly believe that I am a part of the best team in the business, working for the best bosses in the business.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, perhaps I&#39;ll talk about this more on Monday&#39;s show.</p>\n\n<p>For now, thanks to all of you, the amazing fans of this great sport, for your incredible support since the beginning of my career. I do not take it for granted, and it sincerely means the world to me. Thank you for always watching/listening/reading. </p>\n\n<p>As Jay-Z once said, on to the next one ...</p>\n\n<p>Ariel&quot;</p>\n</div>",
