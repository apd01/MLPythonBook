He was gassed in the second. Lauzon called it, the fast weight bulk up killed his cardio. Everyone saying he was being to cocky, trying to be Silva etc.. but it was just his cardio tank. He was on point the first round and outclassed nate, then second round you could see him suddenly start walking around flat footed, big breaths, no more talking etc. He just gassed.
