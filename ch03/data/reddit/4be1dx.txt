Despite the fact that fighters don&#39;t get to do that and have never gotten to do that. They get to wait until the ref determines there is a break in the action and the time is convenient for him to step in and replace the mouth piece.</p>\n\n<p>I never said the round. I said nothing about how the round was going. If you read what I was talking about I was talking about immediately before Mike got rocked. That&#39;s not the whole round. That is the exchange leading up to the end of the round. I don&#39;t know how I can possibly make that clearer. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Herb Dean determined that Bisping was fine to continue because as soon as the round had ended Bisping was coherent and bitching at Herb Dean about not stopping the action to pick up his mouth guard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, there are plenty of examples of fighters bitching after clear KO&#39;s too. Talking or bitching about something doesn&#39;t mean you weren&#39;t out. Watch some knockouts you will see guys complain even when the stoppage was legit and it&#39;ll be almost immediately after the stoppage. </p>\n</div>",
