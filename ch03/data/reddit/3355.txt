Outside of the ring for sure, I think it's great and I love Conor's antics. But inside the ring to do what he did then was just stupid and unprofessional as a mixed martial artist. Anderson Silva tried to pull the same hands down ' hit me ' shit against Weidman the first time and got knocked out. Now Conor probably won't have his covetted title fight with Dos Anjos, Diaz will probably take his place and Conor will probably go back to defending his title at 145 with a rematch against Aldo. All because he had chose to showboat. Very disapointing!
