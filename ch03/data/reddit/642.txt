Even if he is a natural 155, he's still fighting out of his element. Frankie Edgar is a natural 155 who was consistently out sized by expert weight cutters. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not making an excuse for Conor loss, I'm just pointing out how it was a terrible decision to fight at 170. 

Gotta give props to McGregor for having the balls to take this risk though.
