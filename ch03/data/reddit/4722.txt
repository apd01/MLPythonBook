You don't really think all main event fighters get PPV points, do you?  Nobody's that wrong.  Even Trump isn't that wrong.  

Diaz does NOT get PPV points at all.  But he did get $600k with the two 50k bonuses.  That's the most he will ever get paid for anything.  And McG will probably get over a million for his next FTW championship defense.  And he DOES get PPV points on top of that. As does Ronda. And maybe 3-4 others.
