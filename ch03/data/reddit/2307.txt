It wasn't even an early tap. Anyone who says that doesn't roll. And I'm not some big connor fan. That choke was deep under the neck, hands back behind Connors ear. Nate is fuckin legit on the ground, he turned that bone in and squeezed. When it's locked it's locked. The tap wasn't early. That choke was fire.
