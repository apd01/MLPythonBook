That's not the point. That's a very black and white way of looking at things. I'm talking about everything that lead up to the choke, not just the choke. Also, sometimes you see a fighters will when they're getting choked like that. You saw Holly's just before. She did everything she could to get out of it and went out. 

I'm not saying that's always the smartest thing to do. However, sometimes it does pay off. Also, some fighters just have that raw heart and can't control how they react. They naturally fight to get out of it and don't tap.
