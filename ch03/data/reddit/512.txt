THANK YOU! I can't stand reading about this magical "weight difference" Conor fought against. It was 1 fucking pound! This was not a WW fight, it was a LW fight wuthout a weight cut. People are making more of it than necessary. Diaz is no WW. Conor is a beast and can hang with top 5 to 10 LWs, but as we just saw, top 5ers will give him problems. Conor didn't fight a larger man, he just had his massive size advantage nullified.
