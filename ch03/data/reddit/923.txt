Nah. Most people understand that bigger guys usually beat up smaller guys. Connor took a fight for fun against a much larger opponent on short notice and got out-BJJ'd by a double black belt. I don't think most fight fans will look at that and think he now somehow sucks. I'm still excited to see him up against RDA. Jumping up or down ten pounds is reasonable, but 25 is too much for anyone to reasonably throw on and then fight a world class fight.
