They love respectful athletes who have mastered their art like Holm or Maia or DC or MightyMouse. They love ground fighting, hate early stand-ups, and believe that anyone with the guts to fight in a cage is not worthy of the title \"pussy\" no matter how badly they break during the fight. They love when the two men embrace as brothers at the end of a long battle. \n\nThe problem is that the PPV buy-rates artificially boosts the WWE-style fan as the most valuable commodity.

They wear Tapout appeal so people *know* they watch MMA and they're *not* to be fucked with, because if someone watches MMA that means they could totally kick your ass. \n\n\"Alpha\" males and MMA is like Cowboys and Rodeo, it's a way to socialize and interact with men like you or at least men you want to be like, and makes you seem like a badass. I learned that when a coworker came in wearing a Tapout shirt, and at our lunch break I decided to shoot the shit and talk about the next fight (at the time it was Rockhold vs Weidman), dude had no clue who they were but he knew plenty about Chuck Liddell -except that he had retired. I asked him why he wore the shirt if he didn't pay attention to MMA, he tried to play it off like he knew that he had retired and he was just a fan back when he was fighting and I asked him when that was and he just said, \"oh a while back.\"\n\nThe target audience and the *real fans* are two completely separate groups, and the target audience would get pissed if they were watching a fight and the fighter tapped to strikes. It's a shame, but they don't appreciate the beauty of Mixed Martial Arts, they only care about the brutality and blood shed.\n\nEdit: I suppose all I did was repeat what you said but in a longer more contrived way, but what I'm saying is that it's the target audience and the revenue/popularity that they bring to the sport that discourages tapping out.",

I don&#39;t mean like painted up but keeping those cuticles clean/neat and maybe a light gloss. If you haven&#39;t, maybe give it a try. </p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s not the right way to think about it but I wonder if other people share my sentiment.</p>\n</div>",
