That is exactly what Rousey did, except she got knocked the fuck out. I think she has it a little worse, walking away with massive head trauma instead of just a bruised ego. And Connor's bullshit was at least funny sometimes, where as Rhonda's was always purely mean spirited.t1_d0pmpsh

New MMA fan here. Why is Diaz's record (20-10) so poor? He's obviously really good, so how come he has lost 10 times?t1_d0pgkbn
15
"this guy"?     
     
Nate Diaz has been one of the most popular guys in MMA and Reddit/MMA for years.   Man you look silly.  Welcome to Earth.t1_d0pdl32

Unless you have perfect KDAt1_d0pdl32

On top of fighting top guys for a long time, styles make fights

Nate was just a bad match up for Conor. Conor's main tool is his stand up and Diaz's stand up is one of the best. The question was will Diaz chin hold up and it most certainly did.  

So it was just stand up vs stand up and Diaz was sharper and had the better chin. Plus Nate is very good on the ground. While Conor only really has his stand up as a threat and in MMA that can only get you so far. 

Another reason is Conor up until now was fighting smaller guys than him. Now he fought someone who is his weight but also longer and with a bigger reach. A lot of Conors punches were ending up short. t1_d0pdl32
55
Nate has fought almost nothing but top guys for years and years, Mcgregor fought a bunch of midgets and Jose Aldo.t1_d0pdpa3

And he do touch butts in the park too!t1_d0pedm7
3
"Can you elaborate on what you mean by touching butts in the park?" - best questiont1_d0pewfi
1
McGregor and his goofy movement coach, Ido Portal were doing some very odd exercises during the open workout (I think). They were facing each other, and Ido was trying to tap conor's hips while Conor sort of gyrated out of the way. Nate had the absolute best dig on McGregor when he said, "You were playing touch butt with that dork in the park"t1_d0pdpa3

McGregor cuts weight to bully guys smaller than him.

I can't. Any fighter would gladly take the money and publicity.t1_d0pdlf0
2
It's a joke man.t1_d0pctgw
2
People tend to get media attention and endorsements when they are at the top of their game. The curse is nothing more than a regression to the mean. You can't stay on top forever.t1_d0pctgw
2
Seems like the more media and promotion a fighter handles definitely has a detrimental effect. A video game cover might just generally signify that athlete as "the face of its sport at the moment" and thus that guy will probably have more media obligations than anyone. 

Conor was involved in documentaries, TUF, thousands of interviews, world tour, he was talking about movie deals, etc. It's just too much. Meanwhile Nate was home in Stockton grinding and improving with Nick and the rest of his team. 

Aside from that, Diaz looked a lot bigger and longer. Heavy on top once it went to the ground. I think McGregor is outmatched at 170. 155 might be his optimal weight class.t1_d0pe4u5
1
I wonder what Nate weighed when the fight was announced. You think he cut more than McGregor? Not saying it was the difference; just curious. t1_d0pctgw

First They announced the cover literally the night before the rousey fight. Then They picked this event to market the shit out of the game. Pretty wild actually. t1_d0pctgw

I don't think Dana is going to allow Conor to fight at Welterweight again. And especially against the greatest WW of all time. He hasn't earned that, and if Nate...who didn't cut to get to the weight was too much for him, imagine the hyper-athletic GSP who walks around at 200. Steamroll right over him. Conor is the best Featherweight. He should stay there. No shame in that.t1_d0pdgis

Love that part. He didn't just dodge Conor and take this to the ground (like I said he should). He took Conor's best shots, got cut wide open, and kept standing in front of him trading shots.

170 and evidently 209 is too much for Conor. t1_d0pcr4a
-5
Conor went up to 170 in two weeks to make the fight though, I don't think its realistic to expect him to know how to handle his body/energy and regulate it efficiently to fight an opponent like Diaz who is experienced at that weight. Despite Diaz not getting a full camp I think the weight advantage is fucking huge and its something people seem to be underestimating. Watch the post match press conference Diaz is fucked up and despite what the pseudo-MMAexperts are saying its clear that Mcgregor was winning that fight in terms of damage and if he knew his limits better than he would come home with a victory.

Mcgregor will be back, never doubt the persistence of the Irish.t1_d0pcr4a

I felt the weight class issue was being way over looked and didn't reflect in the odds. Definitely was the difference in the fight. t1_d0pdc7l

Nate is a 155 fighter so he's on his way back to 145. Better get that diet in check Conor.t1_d0pcr4a
59
Conor gassed in one round without cutting weight. Consider that for a moment and repeat to yourself: he's better than Jones. LOL. t1_d0pd1oc
0
First of all, I would never say he's better than Jones.

But, adding weight instead of cutting it can also have a negative effect on your gas tank if you gain too much without the proper cardio, etc. All that extra muscle has to be fed, and I'm sure he was conditioning and preparing for a 155 fight. Just 10 lbs above what he's used too. Instead they fought at 170, so neither guy had to cut weight, but it's still 25 lbs above the weight he's used too, and much closer to Nate's natural weight probably. As well as a weight Nate has won some fights at. 

Honestly anything can happen in a fight like this where both fighters are preparing for each other on short notice and both are outside of their normal weight classes, though I'm always going to lean towards the naturally bigger guy having the edge regardless of the odds on winner, etc. t1_d0pdzfo

I don't get it. Could you explain it for me? t1_d0pd1oc

Comment of the thread right here t1_d0pd1oc
5
It didn't look like he gassed to me.  Looked more like he got rocked by a few shots and was dazed and had no answer.  t1_d0pd1oc
6
Actually I kind of saw this. Nate, like Nick, has incredible endurance. Nate has been training for a triathlon. While you don't get burst speed with that training, you do get a huge gas tank at a slightly lower speed. Conor has been doing all this movement bullshit, and while it is definitely good, a car can't run only on breaks, shocks, and a suspension. Endurance beats everything.t1_d0pdd5w

This triathlon training is bs.  After the fight he said he had just gotten back from Cabo when he got the call about the fight.t1_d0piwb7

Gassed in the 2nd round homiet1_d0pdd5w
5
That doesn't excuse his bad conditioning. Nate was fighting at a really low pace for a high level LW and McGregor was tired after 1.5 rounds. If you want to see what the pace of a fight at the top of LW can be, look at Ferguson/Barboza, the RDA/Pettis fight or either of the Alvarez/Chandler fights. Not only do you see the insane pace that many of the top guys in that division can go, they also show just how insane their ability to take enormous amounts of damage is.t1_d0pdd5w

144
And that height difference was monumental. Then consider at 170 you've got wrestling monsters like Hendricks. Imagine Conor fighting Condit or Thompson...

I think Conor let his ego get the best of him. He forgot he wasn't invincible and put himself in a bad situation before and during the fight. Hopefully this brings him back to reality.t1_d0pd7cc
2
> And that height difference was monumental. 

said this [6 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/488z7k/could_it_be_a_winning_week_for_both_guys/d0hupmm)

*Conor is 5'9". in the UFC he's finished Aldo (5'7"), Mendes (5'6"), Siver (5'7"), Poirier (5'9"), Brandao (5'7"), and Brimage (5'4").*

*his only decision was to Holloway (5'11"). his last loss was to Duffy (5'10"). now he fights Nate Diaz (6'0")*

maybe it was coincidence that Conor "struggled" with taller guys, maybe it wasn't, maybe he needed that height and reach over smaller guys to look more dominant than he was. 

we still dont really know tbh, but this is what happens when you make a god out of someone with 7 UFC fights.

People were saying he'd beat Thompson just the other day.  There's no way in hell he would.  Thompson has great accuracy and probably more power than Nate.  

Lawler would explode his head like that gif that was going around recently.  t1_d0pd7cc

TIL, Nate Diaz isn't considered a 155 title challenger by some people.t1_d0pddns
1
Nate could definitely be in title talks but him beating rda would be hard. However I do believe he would blast people like Alvarez and khabib into different dimensions.t1_d0pddns
2
To be fair Nate did challenge for the title and had a hell of a run at 155. He also beat the #6 LW contender recently. It's not like he's a nobody at LW.t1_d0pddns
5
He is a title challenger at that weight. He literally fought benson Henderson for the strap.

He also is coming off some really outstanding performances against Johnson and now mcg. He's absolutely catapulted himself into the contention talk once again.

He may not be the #1 contender, but to say he isn't a title challenger seems a bit silly.

Edit: reread your post, maybe you meant not a title challenger at welterweight. If so, disregard above!t1_d0pddns
5
Hindsight 20/20, RDA might very well have had a field day with Conor and the takedowns as well. For as big as he is none of it seemed to translate into the grappling exchanges at all, he was being easily controlled by Nate even in less dominant positions. t1_d0pddns
35
Yeah Nate had a 2-2 record at 170, he left for a reason, same reason why Conor should aim for 145 and 155 only. 170 is an ocean of fucking monsters. And at some point your power is irrelevant at the higher weight classes when their jabs are harder than your power punches.t1_d0pgt00
1
The more you get stunned from a punch the easier it is for the next punch to land, so guys usually shoot for the panic takedown just to stop getting hit and catch their breath.  Ironically Conor did this to Nate, which is a huge mistake since Diaz is a BJJ blackbelt.t1_d0pdspm

I get why Conor was inviting the exchanges, he was tagging Nate clean with his left.  Nate was just way more composed than any fighter he's faced.  When he hit that 1-2 on Conor's chin he knew he broke him.t1_d0pczw5
2
Conor has knockout power at 145. At 170, it's just a pretty good punch.

Since his whole style is built around knockout power, downgrading that weapon makes him a completely different - way, way worse - fighter.t1_d0pe4nd

102
Don't think that was it at all, he was exhausted from just swinging, what makes you think he had the energy to keep his hands up. I don't think he can fight at 170. t1_d0pcug6
1
Me neither.  He looked out of shape.t1_d0pcug6
1
The issue is, he wasn't fighting at 170. He was fighting at 155 without the cut. If he lost his cardio without cutting, imagine what his cardio would be like with the cut. At the end of the day, his fight weight was about the same, which is 7-8 pounds more than what it was at 145. He needs to learn to manage that extra 7-8 pounds.t1_d0pdz8s
1
145 is too big of a cut, 170 seems to be too much weight for him, 155 seems like the better option.t1_d0pe44t
1
He just got wrecked by a 4th ranked 155er. I think his best weight is the weight he has the belt in. I think he could compete at 155 once he got adjusted but it's hard to say he's clearly a 155er when he just got worked. Does anyone else remember how badly rda beat down Diaz,t1_d0pe44t
1
Agreed. A well managed 155 is perfect for him, and there's too many good fights out there to ignore... 155 is already stacked with murderers, adding McG to the list is just a lot of fun.t1_d0pcug6
1
Yeah, nailed it here. It's exhausting to whiff punches and despite being the smaller guy Conor made no real adjustment from how he fights FWs and whiffed a ton more than usual.

As soon as the left landed for Nate in the 2nd it was clear Conor would need way more than a few seconds to fight like he's fresh againt1_d0pcug6
1
The one thing I really noticed when watching with my brother was that Conor was really swinging for the fences with nearly every punch in the first round. His Aldo knockout and all his own talk must have gotten to him a little bit. To be fair, I was legitimately concerned Nate was going to eat one of those and go to sleep, but my brother and I both thought there was a good chance he could gas hard in the 2nd.t1_d0pg4gu
10
Both of the Diaz brothers are awesome. Neither are shitty.t1_d0pgv9j
2
Mcgregor also said this during one of the pre fight interviews so nate was mocking him t1_d0pcug6
1
I agree. Diaz was actually working the body well while they both kept a high pace. He also had some good work in the clinch along the fence. Mac even said he just burnt out and wasn't efficient. He still landed well but at that pace you gotta either put your man away or be able to keep the pace. t1_d0pcug6
1
I don't think that was the problem, he had his hands down the entire fight and relied on trying to dodge the punches the whole time.  The problem was that Diaz was the most composed fighter he faced and sat back and picked his shots and it got the job done.t1_d0pd8a0
3
Its possible, but even before Diaz hit him, Conor's swings where getting slower and slower and he had to rest to throw more.t1_d0pcug6
2
He should have had more energy. He was planning on fighting at 155 but then took the fight at 170 so he didn't have to cut.t1_d0pcug6

-1
Try running a mile. Then try running a mile with a 30 pound bag on you. When you bulk up like that, throwing punches and moving around cost a lot more energy. t1_d0pdkbv
2
He barely 'bulked' up. His normal walk around weight is 170. He would've weighed in the same as he did if he fought at 145 (with re-hydration). Anthony Johnson is a perfect example. You should have more energy fighting at your walking around weight, weight cut hurts performances. He had poor cardio against Mendes too, its not just cause he 'bulked' up that he ran out of gas. t1_d0pdnbu
0
He didn't even make 170 while bulking so how can you say his walk around weight is 170.t1_d0pgv9j
24
Yep, textbook TKO, and to buy time they try to clinch or take down the opponent. From there they usually turtle up, roll over and expose their back and end with a choke submission. Its happened a thousand times.t1_d0pdscj
1
Conor would love to do it. Conor walks around 80 kilos (177lbs) and he'd still be cutting a bit at '77'," said Roddy.


You act like I'm saying he walks around at EXACTLY 170... which Im not. He's weighs around 170 t1_d0pdxe1
1
Bulking up, eating and gaining weight he ended up weighing 168 for the fight. He looked way too thick for his frame, I honestly don't believe he walks around 177. He looked like someone who just bulked not like someone who didn't do a weight cut, but its an opinion so there's a possibility i could be wrong. t1_d0pcug6
10
A big part of MMA is knowing where you fit in. Look at Rumble, he tried to fight lower weight classes and it didn't work. Conor is a 145er, end of story. t1_d0pd5df
2
I think he's too big for 145 his cuts look awful. He belongs at 155 and really if he didn't get cocky and drop his hands for half the fight, he could have won a decision against Diazt1_d0pcug6
4
I was thinking to myself in the first round, that is so much energy spent on throwing that left. It probably felt like a noodle going into the second round. t1_d0pd2im
3
yeah the first round freaked me out, he was landing really good shots but you could see him get too tired to try to finish.t1_d0pcug6
123
This wasn't a 170 fight.. Sure they weighed in at 170, but like Joe said, this was a lightweight fight without the cut. A welterweight fight would have had them in the ring at 185+t1_d0pcz49
1
This joe shit is silly, someone blowing up from 155 to 168 isn't going to have the same cardio and conditioning as someone who works their Ass of cutting weight. Steaks and beef are known to make you more lethargic, I was worried about this every time he bragged about eating steaks.t1_d0pcz49
7
Diaz definitely wasn't 170 in there you can see the difference between weigh in and night of, he still cut some.t1_d0pcz49

Holy shit these McGregor fans talking about McGregor being 170 blablabla... 

They're the same fucking weight, except neither of them had to dehydrate themselves 24 hours before the fight.

Nate had significant height and reach advantage which comes with him fighting in his proper weight class and Connor not. Also if you force yourself into an unnaturally high weight class you have to put on more muscle and fat which deflates your stamina t1_d0pdqay

Who hasn't been defeated? Struve has much more wins than losses in the heaviest class. Obviously there is an ideal balance.  You don't want to be a short ball of muscle and fat that gases quickly with no reach while at the same time you dont want to be too skinny with no muscle and no power or control.  t1_d0pd1se
8
I don't think you understood anything about what was said. With the extra weight at 170 he looked sluggish and got tired really quickly. Point is Mcgregor bit off more than he can chew 170 isn't a good weight class for him. Nate in 11 days looked more in shape than Conor. t1_d0pd4zm
0
Bullshit, it was painfully clear that McGregor was much faster but didn't have the 170 lbs chin. Diaz was opened up early but Conner had never fought a well rounded iron chin before. Now it's clear he's a flash in the pan at his walking weight and should fight Rhonda for Dana's  hard on fest. t1_d0pd4zm
1
I know what you mean, but I don't think saying that they're "fighting at 170" is correct either, as they didn't have to cut weight before the fight. They just fought at their normal, daily weight; it seemed like to me.

But I agree that Conor looked sluggish. You can't keep your stamina after gaining so much weight in a short period of time. I am surprised he approached the weight-gain in this kind of way. t1_d0pdch7
1
To be honest if Conor bulking and eating like a mad man gets him to 168 i don't think that's his normal weight. I think around 160 would be more accurate. If Nate bulked up like that he could easily hit 190.t1_d0pd4zm
2
You are delusional if you think Connor doesn't rehydrate back up during his fw fights.  You can see how much bigger he is in fwt1_d0piqb9

He punched Conor's head into the choke.  He probably thought he was safe where he was. I don't think McGregor is the type to just give up in that situation. t1_d0pdvuo

Of course he does but its delusional to think when he rehydrates he goes to 170. I would say somewhere near 155-160 would be fair but its only a guess.t1_d0pd4zm

The problem is the insinuation that it was because he was vs a welterweight in a welterweight fight, when the reality is that he was vs a lightweight in a welterweight fight. 

All the 155ers will get into the ring as heavy as Nate and McGregor were tonight. If he wants to fight at 155 he will either need to stay as big as he was tonight and cut down to 155 from that weight like Nate and all the other lightweights, or he can cut some mass and give up a significant weight advantage in exchange for speed and more gas.

Otherwise he needs to stay at 145 where he can dominate people. He could compete and be a contender at 155 for sure, but its unlikely he'd be champ at 155.t1_d0pdr58
2
Theres a 15 pound difference from 170 to 155, i honestly believe that's a lot of mass. Can't be sure he wouldn't gas either at 155 but i would like to think he wouldn't gas in the 1st round. t1_d0pduiu

Thing is if Conor walks into the ring at 155 in a Lightweight fight, there are still guys way bigger than Nate in the lightweight division. Khabib walks around at 194 lbs / 88 kg.

I almost feel like he'd have to at least stay this big, and maybe just take more time to allow his body acclimatize to that weight and see if that makes a difference. But then that would probably mean he wouldn't be able to go back down to defend his belt.t1_d0ply9i
22
Everyone has it in them to give up in that situation. If you know you're going to get the fuck beat out of you until the ref stops it and theres nothing you can do to stop it the smart thing to do is give up the choke. Live to fight another day.t1_d0pe1n0

There is no way in hell that Khabib walks around at 194, unless it's pre fight camp like Rampage. t1_d0pn22b

Well, RDA walks at 195. I wouldn't see why it's impossible for Khabibt1_d0pn22b
1
I assume what you're saying is correct, because I also doubt he is 194 lbs when he steps in the ring, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's around 180 give or take a few pounds.t1_d0pcz49

I think only the Conor maniacs were talking about that fight as if Conor had a chance though. I think everyone else just wanted to see the spectacle of it all. Nate making him and Nick some money and winning (with the added benefit of a fuck you to Dana White) is the best timeline, but everyone has that part of them that just wants to see shit hit the fan.t1_d0pd2nl

15
Not even fair... Lawler would have Mcgregor drinking through a straw for the rest of his life if he attempted to go the distance... but I think we've finally proven that Conner is clearly better suited as a 170 pounder fighting at 145. 

If Conner wants to become champion again, he needs to cut weight again. Clearly his walking weight is too hard unless he wants to fight Holly. t1_d0pdi1w

I agree.  He looked fat and slow, and you could tell in his demeanor that he knew it.t1_d0pd2nl

Without a doubt, Conner was much faster but just doesn't have the strength, chin or heart to move up a class yet. I like Nate but don't love him and didn't question this fight for a second -  Conner is a figment that didn't deserve his position just like Rhonda...

Connor thought he was a young Anderson Silva.t1_d0piqb9

classic ufc move.  its a face saving tap to strikes. understandable.t1_d0pcu57
-1
Connor is a young Anderson Silva. Except he's fighting in 2016 where fighter's know how to work the body and double up on the jab.t1_d0pcu57
1
Nate did to Connor what Nick wanted to do to Silva.t1_d0pcu57
1
This would probably be more akin to Connor trying to employ the Chuck Liddel strategy, in that he attempts to bait you with his face. Chuck Liddel also had a cast iron chin. Chuck Liddel's footwork in regards to cutting angles was actually pretty good. And by doing that, you try to bait the other person to over commit. A lot of power gets generated if the other person over commits since it's the sum of the momentum of your body and theirs.

That's basically what happened. Conor tried to bait Nate into over commiting. But Nate's tall. He doesn't have to take in the extra step to land a good jab to the face. But more importantly, the Diaz brothers both don't over commit to punches either. Which makes this an extremely awkward fight for someone especially of Conor's style. 

And it showed. Conor's left hand, while accurate, didn't do nearly as much damage as it would have normally done. Conor decided to brawl with Nate. He got gassed. Nate slowly turned up those fifty percent shots, and Conor's chin finally started to cave.

I can't help but think that Conor also lost the mind game in this one. With all the shit talking going around, Conor I feel wanted to go in and win with authority. Perhaps he didn't get angry like the way Jose Aldo did. But he certainly didn't fight smart against Diaz. t1_d0pcu57

He was getting lit up. I already know people are going to down play this loss saying how it's 170lbs and all but really as Joe said, this is just two 155lbers fighting without cutting water. 


So for those of you who think Conor is going to have an easy time with RDA or any other top 155lber is wrong.t1_d0pd0vf

Eh there's no telling how RDA would have taken those shots. Nate eats head kicks for breakfast.t1_d0pdvlt

-6
If we're being simplistic fanboys, yeah. But Nate has proven himself average both at 155 and 170; beating Conor doesn't make him GSP. t1_d0pllgy
18
So he doesn't get the fuck beaten out of him until he's unable to defend himself and the ref has to stop it. t1_d0pd0vf
16
He wasn't getting lit up until around the first time he got rocked, before that conor was rolling with all the shots t1_d0pd6by
1
isn't that because of what nate said? starting slow and then picking up the pace gradually.

so i don't think that means conor had the upper hand necessarily, it was just a strategy contrastt1_d0pd6by
25
Maybe not lit up but he was taking jab after jab after jab. Conor said it himself, he wasn't efficient in striking and threw like 20 over hand lefts that first round. Probably because he saw blood from Nate's face and thought he was gonna get him with the next one while just eating up those "insignificant" jab. t1_d0pd99a

It definitely was not a technically sound fight for McGregor. Whether it was arrogance or weight, he didn't look like himself.

But just to be clear: This was all Nate. Take nothing away from Diaz. t1_d0pd0vf
5
Didn't Joe Lauzon say putting on that amount of weight will kill cardio because of his body not being used to performing at that weight? Something along the lines of that. t1_d0pdvyt
1
Which is a weird reasoning, I mean wouldn't all fighters pretty much be at their walk-around weight during most of their camp?t1_d0phq9r
1
Someone else explained to me on another post, they want to be about 10-15 lbs heavier than their weigh in weight. If they are heavier than that during camp they would start cutting then by losing fat, eating less and expending more calories. So it definitely depends on who we are talking about. t1_d0pdvyt
3
He didn't literally go from a 145lb man to 170lbs for this fight. He was around 170lbs normally and cut to 145lbs through dehydrating himself every time he fought before. Not much changed at all for him as far as weight goes this fight, it's just that he didn't have to water cut. t1_d0pe2ox
2
Am aware, I've heard his walk around weight being as high as 175-178 but if that was really walking around weight I think he would have been closer to the 170 mark eating 2 breakfasts and whatever the fuck else. How long do they wait to start actually cutting? Was he mid-cut when RDA pulled and then fight gets switched to 170? Not really sure about the specifics on that, am looking for info not trying to hug his nuts like most here would accuse me of. t1_d0pe7zl
2
If a fighter is very high in weight they have to actually start cutting weight in fight camp. Like actual fat weight by eating less and expending more calories. This is done until they are only 10~15lbs over their weigh in weight.

Now if the fighter is around 10~15lb over their weigh in weight, then they can just wait till the last week and start ramping up their water intake, which leads to more urinating. Some even wait till the last couple days for hot tub method which is more extreme but show cased well by Ronda.t1_d0pd0vf
33
I'm so happy that Conor didn't go up against RDA. RDA would have absolutely destroyed him. Nate is definitely experienced and has the conditioning, but RDA is a monster on another level. I'd say it was in Conor's best interest to lose to this guy instead of the other one.t1_d0pd9ql

Not a particularly great fan of Aldo but I think Conor was destroyed more than Aldo was, a war says a lot more than a single punch. We learned a lot more about Conor's relative strengths, weaknesses and overall level in the Diaz fight than about Aldo in his most recent fight.t1_d0pd9ql
2
I don't know, i agree to an extent. It's different styles colliding though, as we saw Conor struggled with longer fighters but i can't see the same problems he had against Nate occurring against RDA. It's hard to judge a fight based off a different fight with completely different styles.t1_d0pd9ql
22
Totally agree. 

Although losing to another champion in a higher weight class at least allows Conor to save face. A loss to a number 5 LW pretty much says go back to salad. t1_d0pdqns
1
It'll be interesting to see how he handles the weight cut to 145 this time around. His cuts were already pretty dramatic but now after he's packed on more muscle to get up to LW it's going to be ridiculous.t1_d0pdqns
2
A number 5 LW on 11 days notice mind yout1_d0pdqns
14
It is good for him as sort of a reality a check, his best advantage is his reach on the guys at 145. Fight more of the talented guys in that division, keep winning, then move. Similar to what Silva did against James Irvin and Forrest Griffin. Instead of going after the top dog right away, show that you can tear through some of the lower ranked guys, than make your title claim. 
Rushing it only serves to hurt his own career, especially when there are still major faucets of his game that need improvement. t1_d0peeml

Really can't see him beating RDA now. This is like an awkward moment. He was so arrogant and he just seemed to wilt over in there. Obviously he was stunned but even the tap came very fast.

IMO he tapped that fast because nothing was really on the line in that fight that meant something to McGregor. He got his money, he's not losing his belt, he taps fast because he knew he was locked in. Not worth letting it go on in his mind.t1_d0pdapg

RDA is so much faster than either of them too. Definitely has more power than Diaz. Mcgregor threw everything in to his punches 1st round and that's why he gassed I think. Diaz wasn't even doing much work on his body. t1_d0pegig

I'd have to watch the fight again but to me, he was very stunned. The punch nate landed on his chin had a lot to do with him looking gassed.t1_d0pdapg

I'm disappointed that you could see when the going got tough, he broke. not that he lost. It's more so because he talks about other fighters breaking and pulling out of fights because they break. Breaking while competing is a thing. It's not always as simple as "he just lost the fight". t1_d0pe561

Who took the fight on short notice man. Both did, except one had a full camp and yea it's the first damn time Conor fought someone who was good that had a reach advantage on him. They are still both weighing in basically the same weight without cutting water meaning they are literally the same size in the ring. t1_d0pdnq7

6
what's ridiculous about it? You can try and spin it and say it's a high level fight and people have to lose etc but he really gave up in there when the going got tough. You can see how his demeanour changed after nate took his shots. It's the fact that he talks about people breaking and fighters pulling out and stuff, yet the will was sucked out of him pretty quickly. Is he still a warrior? of course.... but it's simply the fact that he talks so much about other fighters' will and his will just was visibly not there.t1_d0pe2mr
-1
The way i saw it is Conor gassed very early, it took about 1.5 rounds and he looked gassed. It has nothing to do with Nate taking his shots because he was opening Nate up good. As for giving up, the choke is in deep, he is completely gassed and probably still dazed. I mean he could've flailed about and struggled for a few seconds but what difference would it have made ?t1_d0pe6jx
6
I guarantee the fact that Nate was taking his shots fucked with his confidence to an extent. Everyone else fell. When a knockout artist finds someone who can take their shots, it fucks with their confidence. After he was rocked, the will just got sucked out of him and fast. I believe there are quite a lot of fighters who in the situation, there heart would carry them through. But again... it's simply that he talks about other fighters not having will and being pussies and breaking easy. If he didn't do that so much, I wouldn't feel this way.t1_d0pdnq7
11
This is what got me. The whole "cowboy giving up" and real fighters dont do that or whatever. Then he tapped in like 2 seconds. I was like, Conor, you were my boy. Now im so disillusioned.t1_d0pe5u7

As a counterpoint, Holly fought til the very end. Class act.  Sad to see her lose.  Can't say the same for Conor.  Hope he'll change his persona and be better post-loss.t1_d0pe5u7

That's ridiculous. There was no getting out of that choke.t1_d0pgclo

That's not the point. That's a very black and white way of looking at things. I'm talking about everything that lead up to the choke, not just the choke. Also, sometimes you see a fighters will when they're getting choked like that. You saw Holly's just before. She did everything she could to get out of it and went out. 

I'm not saying that's always the smartest thing to do. However, sometimes it does pay off. Also, some fighters just have that raw heart and can't control how they react. They naturally fight to get out of it and don't tap.t1_d0pcw3h

Everything that led up to the choke? You mean Conor getting rocked? Give him a break man he didn't quit.

I don't blame him for tapping. That's stupid. There's nothing to gain by going unconcious. McGregor just had to learn that weight classes matter. He just doesn't have the power or durability to fight the way he does against top LWs. t1_d0pelau

I'm as xxxHardfuckingcoreXxx as the rest, but we bitch about fighter pay then we bitch about casuals. We can't have it both ways. Half the people in the sub openly admit to pirating ppvs, the sport cannot survive without casuals. If we want better fighter pay and to legitimize the sport in the eyes of the public, we NEED casual fans. t1_d0pgpuz

I'm still a huge McGregor fan. But the way he went into this was really disappointing.. You're not Anderson Silva... t1_d0pcwep

I don't see any reason for people to stop liking McGregor. What they need to do is stop believing he's a transcendental talent. He's an elite fighter at 145 and very charismatic. That's good enough. He doesn't have to be UFC's Jesus. 

Nate Diaz beat the shit out of him. Period. Lesson learned.t1_d0pe8t6

> He's an elite fighter at 145

until he beats Edgar, hes a "very good" fighter at 145t1_d0pe8t6

Agreed. This fight actually MADE me a Connor fan. I WANT him to defend his title and whoop ass. There is something about when a superstar eats humble pie that I think it will make them a better fighter, and I can relate to them more. Dunno, I'm rambling. 

All I know, is I didn't like seeing Connor lose like that, and up till now I haven't been a fan. Weird, huh? t1_d0pcwep
168
So I got one of my friends into MMA over the summer and he basically became the hardest McGregor dick-rider imaginable.

He was trying to argue to me tonight that Conor would easily beat Jon Jones without having seen a single Jones fight.

Tonight felt real, real good.t1_d0pe1cq

2
To be fair when you get into the sport you should have a few fighters to root for, it's good for MMA. When I first started watching I was a big matt hughes fan and that fact that he was good kept me interested in the sport.t1_d0pk0rm
3
I have zero problem with having someone to root for and I totally agree.

The issue I take is that a new fan, with literally zero knowledge of the sport was trying to act like he knew everything about the game and the fighters despite never seeing any of their fights.

Like after the Aldo loss, saying that he knew that knockout would happen when he didn't even know who Aldo was three months prior.

It was just ridiculous.t1_d0pk0rm
3
Yeah, I'm fairly new and I like McGregor because he's entertaining as hell and I know fuck all about the fighters in the ufc. I watch the fights and either have to root for someone arbitrarily or just root for a good fight (usually what I do). Guys like McGregor and Rousey may be a pain in the ass to veteran UFC fans, but they bring in the viewers. t1_d0pe1cq
2
Please tell me you won some of your friends money on this fight. t1_d0pe1cq
3
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Just comparing the size of Jones should make one understand how dumb that thought is.t1_d0pe1cq
4
A buddy of mine got me into MMA recently. I've been working in a sports bar for six years and only really started enjoying MMA since Dillashaw won the belt. (I think that was the fight where I was like "Holy shit! This is fucking awesome!!") Anyway, when McGregor got choked out, I could hear a bunch of people screaming "AND NEW!!" and even in my novice fandom of MMA I wanted to smack them for not knowing what the fuck they were talking about. I can only imagine how you felt when your friend said that to you. t1_d0pe1cq

Oh good god, that's what I'm the happiest about. Those band wagon fans will fuck right off. Their ignorance just drives me nuts. Booing DC for fucksake. Thinking Jones would lose to Conor. Everyone is a pussy etc.t1_d0pcw3h
1
People need to give him shit about that for the rest of his life. Just yell 209 every time you see him, especially during live events.t1_d0pgss2
5
You would not believe the amount of shit I had to bite my tongue at because he had zero knowledge of the sport and could not be reasoned with.

The Jones comment tonight was the most egregious though. t1_d0pgyw7
3
Yeah I had a casual watching who thought Conor should win purely because he looks like a fighter more than Nate hahat1_d0pgss2
3
The funniest one I saw was the website for The Mirror, a British tabloid. Every time I googled anything about the fight in the past couple of weeks they'd always be in the top results with some of the most ridiculous headlines I've read. One of them even claimed that Conor "slaughtered" Diaz at the weigh-ins.

I hate to give any traffic to that rag but I had to check it this morning to see the reaction. Lots of stories about how shocking the result was.t1_d0pgss2
4
I'm a new fan to the sport, and a fan of McGregor. But I do educate myself and still am a fan of his after this loss. So long as he doesn't lose his confidence and stays strong in his weight division, I'll support him. t1_d0pr185
-1
That's very risky to say in this subreddit man; nobody hates new fans more than this place. They hate against the popular fighters time after time because they don't want to be confused with the band wagon, lest someone think that *they're* the new ones.t1_d0ptkjw
6
Then the people here need to stop worrying about what other people think and be themselves :/t1_d0pr185
2
Fair-weather fans are just as bad in my opinion.

I'm fan of Conor as well - I picked him to beat Aldo (obviously not in the way he did though) and am a little sad that he lost even though I was rooting for Nate.

New fans are what will make this sport grow and I think as long as they don't act like they have it all figured out they should be welcomed with open arms.t1_d0pcwep

If you have been a true fight fan for at least 5+ years, this shouldn't be TOO shocking. Diaz brothers are beloved by MMA fans for a reason; their chins are legitimately solid and they always come to fight. But I think this fight dispels the constructed notion that weight classes don't matter. They fucking do. Most of those lefts by Conor would've slept lighter fighters. Granted Diaz bros have chins like no other, but I hope this puts to rest the belief that Conor could dismantle Robbie. t1_d0pdpvi
1
It's true people don't respect differences in weight as much as they should. Except in this case both fighters walk around at 170 and Diaz didn't train for the fight so this was just a case of one guy being better.t1_d0pdpvi
1
Dude, I remember my older brothers jumping and losing their shit as Gomi gassed. These guys have a special place among my mma memories.t1_d0pdpvi
1
...makes me think of Ultimate Fighter when some lightweight told a much heavier fighter he couldn't KO him.

So he does. t1_d0pdpvi
1
Very true. It was silly to think that Mac could fight legit at 170 when guys cut a ton to get to that weight class. Either way, good on both fighters for taking the fight and it was a blast to watch!! McGregor will he back and he has his belt. It is a humble defeat and he took it well. As Diaz won lmaot1_d0pcw3h

There are three kinds of people in this thread (any thread where Conor is mentioned).

Yep. Facebook and Twitter has become unbearable for me due to an influx of obnoxious new fans (not that I have a problem with new fans at all) who just repeat Conor's one liners. This should knock em down a peg or two and hopefully the stay watching the sport and start appreciating all fighters and not just Conor.t1_d0pdpvi
4
He had no place in WW, he can't beat any of the top 5 WW. Connor hits hard, but lawler hits harder. If Connor cant put his opponent to sleep than how can he win? he has no ground game. I was impressed with his ability to throw bombs at Nate, I think he had a legitimate shot against RDA and the LW division. We learned today that anyone with a chin and good wrestling can dismantle mcgregor.t1_d0pdstw
6
I wouldn't say ANYONE with a chin and good wrestling. Any fighter that fights above 155 with the two aforementioned attributes can probably beat Conor. But I'm still a fan and I think he'll still dominate the lower weight divisions. t1_d0pdstw
14
But why are you pretending that Nate is a WW? This is a LW who always come short against the very best at LW. 

RDA would have mauled this Conor and already wrecked Nate. He doesnt play no stupid "stand in front and box" game. t1_d0pe6ce
7
Well the thing is, Connor thinks he can beat lawler at WW, and lost to what you said is a LW diaz. So he lost to someone who is kind of a gate keeper in LW at a WW fight. Imagine a REAL WW fight, he would get shit on by lawler/condit/thompson/ hell probably even hendricks. t1_d0pehc5
8
He definetly would. But this fight didnt make his chances look any good against rda. t1_d0pdpvi

8
Lol abso-fucking-lutely. DC and Jones are Light Heavyweight (205lbs). But before we get that far they need to cross Middleweight (185lbs) champ Luke Rockhold. There's no legal way Nate or Conor would beat Rockhold, he would head kick them to sleep. So yes Nate or Conor going to 205 (if even possible for their frame) will be suicide. t1_d0pdpvi

<POW!>t1_d0pgnxc
2
There are several components - to an extent your neck musculature helps, good awareness so that you see the shots coming helps, being able to roll with punches helps. You can partially train mental toughness but a lot of it is innate, and there are other (and unexplainable) major elements to "chin" that cannot be trained.t1_d0qxx2b

Edit: clip of Diaz calling him out https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tfu31-vEwgo&t=38m15st1_d0pdpvi

Of course weight classes matter, Connor dismantling the division below where he should have been fighting proves that; however that's irrelevant here because both guys are natural lightweights and weighed in about the same weight. t1_d0pdpvi
55
a few things about the diaz bros. 1) they pretty much lose every first round, so don't get to excited 2) they pretty much bleed when the wind blows too hard 3) don't ever ever smile and think you want to start a brawl with them and trade shots, bad idea and all the sudden those pitter patters are smashing your skull in.

STOCKTONt1_d0ped1d
2
You see Nate Diaz's shoulders drop and he starts playing around with that left/right combo: bye-bye whoever is in front of him.t1_d0ped1d
3
> they pretty much lose every first round

I don't know if they're doing it intentionally, but they basically let themselves get hit so the other guy starts throwing higher volume.

They efficiently strike back with those little pitter patter punches that people entirely misjudge.  They're not single-hit-KO shots, so people don't avoid them like they should.

They think they're landing a lot of damage on the Diaz (which they kind of are) and they think they're not really taking too much damage back.  So they keep exchanging and then find themselves asleep.

The punch that ended it for Conor was basically a kung fu double punch.  A left hook hidden behind a pitter patter backhand.  Effing brilliant.

t1_d0pi8xr
2
> I don't know if they're doing it intentionally, but they basically let themselves get hit so the other guy starts throwing higher volume.

Yup it's called rope-a-dope, Muhammad Ali used to do it. I'm not sure that's actually their intention, they just take time to get into the fight like Nate said.  t1_d0pi8xr
2
cmon mate... it was a 1,2 combo, same as he hit johnson with a million times. t1_d0pdpvi
28
That's a pretty accurate comment. I have no idea for how long McGregor can cut to featherweight limit, but I have a feeling he will stay there. He lost to Nate Diaz, RDA is a terrible match up for him, and Nurmagomedov is even worse for McGregort1_d0pdytu

So are Pettis, Alvarez and Ferguson.t1_d0pdytu
11
Oh my god I can't even begin to visualize the utter decimation Khabib would bring to Conor. t1_d0pe67i

If anyone truly believed that Conor could beat Lawler with no ufc fights above featherweight then they are fucking delusional. t1_d0pej5z

I believe Nate could beat Robbie. How bout that!t1_d0pej5z
1
I'm floored people ever thought this. t1_d0pej5z
1
Lawler vs Conor could have been the first death in the octagon. Conor doesn't appear to do so well against straight punches and only avoids damage by keeping range and Lawler would throw right down the pipe and take his head off. t1_d0pej5z
2
Robbie wouldn't just beat Conor, he'd break him. Not to mention fighting Condit would be akin to getting tossed into a wood chipper.t1_d0pej5z
3
I've been saying this for weeks and weeks ever since the Lawler rumours. Everytime I was shot down with "Conor's too technical for him" and shit like that. This just goes to show that the fancy shit doesn't matter. t1_d0pgguy
4
Conor fans are the BJ fans of 8 years ago when people were in all seriousness saying he could beat Fedor by sticking and moving and then using his BJJ if it got to the mat.t1_d0pej5z

So many people were going on and on about Conor being able to pick apart Lawler, including Brendan Schaub. Kinda like when everyone thought Ronda was Superwoman and could beat up men like Mayweather. t1_d0pg7fd

Is that seriously your response to that? I point out Diaz has had a middling career in the UFC and you come back with 'there's like 7 billion people on the planet'. My god, fanboys are pathetic people, regardless of which fighter from last night you're suckling on. Diaz has never been a threat to any champion. He's a good boxer, an entertaining fighter, but he's lost nearly half his fights in the UFC for a reason.t1_d0pd6pd

I just started getting into it. I've never been into any sports but after hearing Joe Rogan's podcasts it has helped me deeply appreciate every aspect about martial arts. 

After hearing all the hype around Connor Mcgregor and the lack of support on the internet for Nate, I thought Nate Diaz didn't stand a chance because maybe he wasn't skilled enough, though I did want Nate to beat that cocky motherfucker. When Connor started getting dizzy, my heart started racing. When he tapped out, i went ballistic. Never in my life have I ever screamed for any team or athlete. What a great fucking fight and what a great sport. t1_d0pe0oh
1
Oh man, that's exactly what I love about the sport. Any other sport you watch has a timer, and you watch until the end, and nobody can win until the end. Shit goes out the window in MMA, winning and losing happens on a dime, whether the timer is up or not.

The excitement and build up you mentioned was exactly what I felt watching the two mains, and I've been a fan since I was a kid watching UFC with my oldest brother and then renting them on VHS. The excitement never goes away. Such drama tonight!t1_d0pcw3h

That may still be up in the air. That fight would've been at 155. The heavier punches Conor took tonight may have less an impact  15 lbs lighter. t1_d0pd0nn

Robbie Lawler is the Welterweight champ but Diaz usully fights at Lightweight. The only reason this fight was at 170 was because it was too short notice to cut down to 155.t1_d0pd51y
1
WW champ is Robbie Lawler. No fight scheduled yet(im pretty sure). But Nate Diaz is a light weight fighter and the LW champ is Rafael Dos Anjos. Conor was supposed to fight him before he got injured

Edit: in terms of Diaz fighting Dos Anjos, yeah its quite likely as i dont think conor will get a shot nowt1_d0pd51y

The current WW champion is Robbie Lawler. Nate Diaz most likely is not in line for a title shot at WW though.t1_d0pdeh0

We already seen that fight.  Nick knocked lawler out. t1_d0pdeh0
3
I'm pretty sure he's staying at LW. I think WW was mostly due to late notice.

Edit: context is everything. I see what you were saying given what the other guy was asking. t1_d0pdeh0
5
Lol, I love Nate Diaz, but he would get decimated by Lawler.t1_d0pd51y
10
Currently Robbie Lawler is the Welterweight(170lbs) champion, but no, Diaz will not be fighting Lawler.

Alright, so, Conor McGregor is a fighter that fights in the Featherweight(145lbs) division. Before each fight, the fighters will weight in to make sure they are 145lbs or less. Most fighters at the highest levels will essentially starve themselves and dehydrate themselves the final week leading up to the fight, in order to drop a ton of weight. The night before the fight they intake a ton of water/food etc and gain their body weight back, so they are much heavier and stronger than they were when they weighed in the night before. So you can quickly come to the realization that Conor probably actually weighs quite a bit more than 145lbs, but by having the ability to cut so much weight, he gains an advantage by fighting mostly smaller guys if he can cut weight better than the rest of his division. Obviously he has to be a skilled fighter too, but size is definitely an advantage. 

Nate Diaz is a figher who has been fighting in the Lightweight(155lbs) division. They cut weight on that division like any other division. So naturally, we know that Diaz also weighs much more than 155 lbs normally. The same goes with Robbie Lawler (170lbs division). He also weighs more than his division's listed weight. 

Now, with this particular fight. It doesn't really mean that much imo. Conor has dominated the 145lb division so completely, that he wanted to move up in weight classes and fight bigger guys in the 155lb division. He was scheduled to fight Dos Anjos, the current Lightweight(155lb) champion. Dos Anjos however, had to back out of the fight due to injury sustained while training. At the last minute (11 days before the fight) the UFC had to find a replacement to fight Conor, in order to provide their customers with entertainment that they had planned on seeing this weekend. They gave Nate Diaz the call, and he agreed to fight Conor. Typically in a short notice replacement fight, fighters have been known to fight at a "Catch Weight". Essentially a weight in between the fighters because one has been training for months in anticipation of a fight, while replacements have often been resting, and aren't as in shape, ready to meet the rigorous conditioning and weight cutting requirements, etc. In a catch weight bout, there is no title on the line, it is purely a fight for the fans entertainment. This fight was rumored to originally be a 160 or 165lb catch weight I believe, but Conor is a huge advocate against weight cuts, and just said lets do it at 170 so Diaz isn't stressing his body last minute to cut weight. Again, that's the rumor I heard on this sub, but I don't have a source on hand. Also, gaining weight and fighting is not an easy task. The thing with added muscle is, that muscle has to be fed by oxygen, so anytime a fighter gains weight, they typically expend much much more energy when fighting than they would at a lower weight. Another side of the weight cut is, if you have dehydrated yourself too much a week before the fight in order to bring your weight down, you are also stressing your body, and might not have much energy to begin with. So there's a balance that fighters must find, and try to fit into a division that gives them the biggest advantage, while still maintaining as much strength and endurance as possible. 

So anyhow. Nate Diaz has always been an entertaining fighter, but he's had some losses here and there, and he's not necessarily seen as an elite Lightweight fighter right now. A very good one for sure though. He will definitely not be going to fight the 170lb Champ, as that guy is massively bigger than Diaz. He also isn't likely to get a straight title shot at Dos Anjos either, because he would be jumping a lot of fighters in that division ahead of him in line for Dos Anjos. What will most likely happen is, Dana White will give him a tough fight somewhere just below Dos Anjos, as a show of good faith for Diaz jumping in on short notice, and taking a fight with Conor to save UFC's Fight Event tonight. If Diaz has a good showing there, then he's likely to be thrust into a title shot, or a fight away from a title shot at 155lbs. t1_d0pdz9b

Connor is the ufcs golden boy. There is no belt or title but beating the golden boy does mean something. I wouldn't be surprised if this boosts Diaz to a title shot at light weight.

Also Connor is the 145 pound champ. He moved up to 170 which is two weight classes above his fighting weight and fought a top ten fighter but not a champ in Diaz. He still is the 145 champ but his auar of invincibility is no longer there. Risky move by Connor but huge pay off. Looks like it didn't work.t1_d0pdf8a

For every weight class, there's a champion. For instance, we just saw Miesha Tate take the bantamweight belt from Holly Holm. 

Conor is the champ at 145, featherweight. He is (was) super cocky and wanted to make a run for a belt at a higher weight class and that's what the Dos Anjos fight would have been (at lightweight - meaning Conor would go from 145 to 155 lbs). However Dos Anjos broke his foot and was pulled out. He was replaced by Diaz (#5 lightweight) at an even higher weight class (welterweight, 170). While the fight took place at 170, this really was a lightweight battle where neither guy was forced to cut weight (a standard practice). Because this fight was outside the featherweight class where Conor is champ, he will remain the champ for featherweights. As long as Diaz doesn't try going down to 145 :Pt1_d0pdf8a

I've been thinking this for a while and I should do more research into it. But Richard Perez was/is an Olympic/Amateur style boxing coach. Amateur boxing is a much much different style than pro due to it being scored differently and having headgear. They focus more on "pop pop pop" style than throwing massive knockout-shots (as seen by the Diazs) and I think this Diaz bros are the perfect prototype for the style on top of having fantastic technique.

So... Can we officially declare a curse is almost definitely happening involving the cover stars on the UFC video games? Look at the track record.. 


UFC Undisputed 2009 - Forrest Griffon (Embarrassing KO to Silva)

UFC Undisputed 2010 - Brock Lesnar (Medical emergency takes him out of the sport indefinitely)

UFC Undisputed 3 - Anderson Silva (Lost title and broken leg)

EA UFC - Jon Jones & Alexander Gustafsson (Title stripped from him. Gus gets off kind of easy on this list as he has just kind of become background noise in the division)

EA UFC 2 - Ronda Rousey & Conor McGregor (Do I really even need to mention why?)t1_d0pd4iw
0
Yup guys this is classic "regression to the mean"- you make a thing that rewards people for acting exceptionally who for a moment seem untouchable and then you say they're cursed when they simply come back down to the average. And you're not tracking any of the other guys and finding a particular meaning in their wuss and losses or weird scenarios. t1_d0pd4iw
1
That's scary stufft1_d0pd4iw
2
Yeah, but how long after the video game came out did they lose their belts?t1_d0pd4iw
3
Its not a curse. Games take a couple years, or at least a year to make, market, and release. Thats a long time to stay champ/relevant. They are always trying to capitalize on current fighter popularity but cant get the game made fast enough to ride the coat tails of their apex popularity. By the time they get there, they are too late. 

They shouldnt announce the covers until weeks before, or maybe not until the game is released; that way they can switch it up if they need to.

I was screaming at my TV! Clowning is one thing when you're slipping the punches, but when you've been tagged it's time to start taking your defense seriously! When he shot for that takedown I didn't even know what to say. I wish I'd remembered the quote /u/gustove remembered lolt1_d0peavz

That first punch that got him in the chin. Connor was a goner after that. He looked lost and got hit 4 more times right after.After that he tried to go to the cage and last it out there, he got hit a few more times. Finally he decided going to the ground would be his best option. Pretty good decision making, but that one hit just destroyed him, fight was lost after that. t1_d0pcsc0

his hands were down cause he was rocked, same reason he shot for a takedown.  he was getting tagged on the feet.  he couldn't take any more punches.  it's called a desperation takedown for a reason.  were you watching the fight?t1_d0pcv84

"They all try to become wrestlers"t1_d0pcv84

That's true once he got hit solidly, but before that mcgregor was acting like a jackass.  He was owning Diaz with his left hand to the face, but then he got cocky as he thought Diaz was about to go down.  

He put down his hands and clearly left a window for Diaz to come back, which he did, and then mcgregor got his ass handed to him.

2
Thank you. Yea he was being a cocky fuck before he got hit, but after that it was essentially over. For a second I thought he was able to regain composure when Diaz stood him up against the wall, but that quickly proved not true. 

He went for the takedown not because he thought he was going to be able to do anything, but in hopes that he could stall out the round. I don't get why people can't see that.t1_d0peavz

He was getting tagged only because he wasn't keeping his hands up until the 1-2 punch that landed on his chin.  He can't open himself up like that.t1_d0pcy7t

There were a few times where Connor looked like he intentionally let Nate hit him with a stiff jab. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. What a great way to end a Saturday though, that was my favorite fight of the past few years.t1_d0pcy7t

he was getting tagged a ton in the first round too, he was straight up out boxed.t1_d0pcy7t
7
Nah dude. He was tagging Diaz until he got hit by that accurate as fuck shot. After that his hands were down because he was wobbled.t1_d0pd7x9
2
I mean we can agree to disagree but I feel that he shouldn't have taken it easy as he did, when you tag nate a couple times he should have just turned on the aggression and go in with more shots.  He'd get a couple in, take a step back and just have his hands down, then he does a big right swing which misses and it goes downhill from there.  Not to mention he almost seemed kinda gassed prior to getting tagged by that 1-2.  t1_d0pd7x9

Watch it again, towards the end of the first round, he just stops defending acting as if Nate doesn't hit hard enough to hurt him.t1_d0pcv84

Beating someone at their worst does not mean you are better than them at their best. Weidman beat Silva at a time in his life where Silva probably shouldn't be fighting anymore. What /u/Goldenkidney is trying to say is that Weidman will never be as good as Silva was in his *prime*.t1_d0pehzh

It's weird how the times change so fast. Realizing that Anderson was fighting when Rich Franklin, Matt Serra, Matt Hughes, Randy Couture, Chuck Liddell, etc were household names that you knew you'd be seeing that year.

I was saying this after Anderson's last fight against Bisbing, I don't think I have ever seen bleed in the UFC. I don't know if it's his ability to evade shots or the fact that there's not a hair on his body to produce friction but the man never gets cut.t1_d0pdf5n

I think if he'd made it to the third round he might have been able to make a fight of it again. If he's just avoided getting into any more slugfests and extended to the bell but no, he went for a takedown on a Jiu Jitsu blackbeltt1_d0pcqlu

Unlike most fighters who wait until you get hit and hurt then stand around looking for the perfect punch until you're 10 feet away recovering the Diaz strategy is to keep throwing at all times so once you're hit and they're hurt, they're hit a few more times so they're standing in front of you instead of ten feet away. t1_d0pcqlu

I'm telling you he got rocked and tried to act like he wasnt. He just stood there trying to act like shit was sweet and just ate a combo from Nate and then he was really fucked.

28
Looked like he got him at least once but I'd have to rewatch.  Diaz ate some bombs though.t1_d0pd2t7
2
Yeah he did take some good shots but they we're all towards that cut. Fair play to Nate he weathered the storm and put Conor away. Conor looked exhausted in round 2.t1_d0pcv0k
6
I think anyone who's ever boxed/sparred before will know that your ability to take a punch is hugely diminished once you become fatigued.

Conor thought he could see off Diaz early, and threw a lot at him, not accounting for how his power might not translate to 170lbs against a naturally bigger guy.

Conor was the one expending himself, Diaz took a lot of punishment but he wasn't really expending himself. He's a triathlete as well so he still had a lot left in the tank if he managed to ride out the storm, which is precisely what he did and he seized his chance.

Once Conor tired his overconfidence really came back to haunt him and it was reckless to fight that way, and not get the finish.

Your ability to take a punch once you're fatigued is hugely diminished, believe me, I speak from experience.

Might not have seemed that way initially, but I think Diaz actually fought a really smart fight.t1_d0pet7p
1
yeah man.  It's not even like punches hurt more when youre tired, but when you get hit while fatigued your body is just ready to give out on you.  I think the crazy triathlete cardio that the diaz bros have is a huge reason they have such good chins.  Their body just doesnt give out on them.t1_d0pcv0k
8
He was, but that's also how he fights. Let's not pretend like this was something unique to tonight. Conor's always been hittable, always kept his hands down or out to counter, and he got exposed tonight. His defense and his smoke and mirrors left hand were both exposed.t1_d0pd5p3
1
Not always, he used to be much more elusive, just his last few fights, his style has changed.t1_d0pcv0k
21
Diaz ate about 10-15 much harder hits and kept coming. McGregor tried to do the same when he got caught with a good one but he started wobbling and it was over. 

He must have known he would be in trouble if he didn't finish it early because he was aggressive going for a knockout in the first. He even said he didn't manage his energy correctly. Stepping up that much weight that fast has consequences. t1_d0pcob7

Nate is usually a slow starter, and Conor is usually really aggressive. Most of his punches actually hit nothing but arms and air, though he did win the first by pure aggression.

-1
Nate's eye was fucked and his face is a bloody mess. Hitting someone's arms doesn't do that. Diaz survived in this fight by his chin and McGregor gassing/getting lazy way more so than being a "more skilled boxer".

Me, too. After the first couple minutes all my confidence was gone. conor didn't look like he had, or cared for, a plan. So, he stood there and tried to Diaz Diaz. Got popped for it.

1
>this many mma fans getting worked

why am i never surprisedt1_d0pcon7
1
I immediately felt like the way he was fighting he was bound to get tagged. Diaz bros throw a lot of volume, so betting his defense on being elusive was a really bad idea.

I felt like it was obvious that he shouldnt have been doing that. If you go into a fight its common sense to assume you might get hit at some point, even if its random. Who do you think u are, fucking Neo? t1_d0pcon7
1
Serious reality check.t1_d0pdwb4
1
Spoken like someone who has never seen him fight. He wins a lot of fights in similar fashion, by waiting it out and using his reach to dismantle people when they gas. Literally just had to touch McGregor's chin once and we was done... McGregor threw a bunch of winging shots that hit nothing and landed a few good ones, but in the end Nate was the one who kept composed and proved he was the better fighter standing and on the ground.t1_d0pcon7
2
He basically learned the hard lesson that guys at higher weight classes hit a hell of a lot harder than the little guys that he out-sized at 145.

And to think people were talking about him and Robbie, lol. He'd be dead.t1_d0pcon7
2
Can we lay to rest that the Diaz bros don't hit hard?t1_d0pczyt
10
I'd say they don't hit hard often, not that they can't hit hard. Both Diaz brothers tend to go with death by a thousand cuts rather than dropping an atom bomb. Doesn't mean they can't. t1_d0pcon7
2
Deserved it for the cheap shot before the fight more than anything else imo. t1_d0pcon7
2
Not a Conor fan at all but no way in hell he was fighting cocky. He was fighting like he always fights (back and forth movement, range control, counter-striking) except this time he was fighting an opponent with a better chin, quicker jabs, and longer reach than he'd ever fought before. Watch the fight again if you can and notice how many punches he slipped or just outright avoided. You don't have to be cocky to get Stockton Slapped. t1_d0pcon7
2
He fought nates fight. And nate has been doing this shit for evert1_d0pcon7

I think he'll be humbled and learn. He'd be knocking everyone out the past few years and probably felt indestructible. A good beatdown can always help anyone get back down to earth.t1_d0pcon7

He fought like he always fights. Controlling distance with long troll shots to find an opening for the left hand. Nate consistently slipped to his right and his strategy went down the drain, so much that his corner started telling Conor to forget about the left and try tagging him with the right.t1_d0pcq6r

He let him swing because Nate doesn't throw with a lot of power most of the time. However if you stand there with your hands down, a bloke is going to load up and bang on your chin. He got hurt, Nate kept hitting him and the rest is history. t1_d0pcuoz

Yeah Diaz doesn't have that one punch KO, he's a volume fighter. And Conor gave him the chance to put on volume.t1_d0pcuoz

I wasn't knocking Nate.  The Diaz Bros are my favorite fighters to watch.  Was just making an observation.  Another observation is that willingly going to ground against a Diaz is suicide.  You may as well just tap.  I had to go back and watch Nick's fight against Gomi after.

Mark Hunt is a beast though.  He's got cement in his hands.  t1_d0peiwc

First time fighting another southpaw with a longer reach.  McGregor has enjoyed a reach and size advantage in his other fights.  

It's interesting when guys who typically have reach advantages fight against someone with a similar or longer reach.  Jones got busted up by Gustafsson, Klitchko looked like shit against Fury, McGregor's whole range game went out the window against Diaz.  It's a big adjustment.t1_d0pcv24

Yeah, it looked like Nate did the same thing earlier in the round, and it worked. t1_d0pda76
3
You're right, he was doing it too! I think they both did it at least a couple times. I think when Diaz did it though, he already had a ton of space between himself and McGregor. When McG feigned it, he was still in range and getting hit. Rough.t1_d0pcv80
204
Yeah I thought so too. He got shaken by a strike then laughed and shook his head and clowned a bit to feign confidence. Unfortunately Nate Diaz doesn't give a shit about mind games.t1_d0pcwly

I think its the opposite. Nate Diaz LIVES for the mind games so he saw through the ploy and said it doesn't matter Imma keep hittin this fucker.t1_d0pcwly

you are taking my comment way too seriously t1_d0pdkrn
-1
I really hope not. It takes balls to go from 145 -> 170 and take anyone on short notice. It is a whole different ball game at that weight and Conor just jumped in head first. He took the loss in the best fashion he could. 

If people don't know he trash talks to sell fights, they are just naive.    Although I do think Conor was a bit to cocky during the fight. Just keep you hands up man!t1_d0pcob7

Not really. As someone who has practiced Jiu Jitsu. When it comes to chokes, it's common practice to tap while sparring, but in a match or a fight you fuckin ride that shit out. You try your best to escape, and you hold out until the last possible second if you can. Especially if it's a championship match. t1_d0pe8gx
2
The key phrase is hold out to the last possible second. I've trained a bit as well, but I still believe that tapping is the smart move if there's no escaping the sub.Obviously fight it until all escapes are denied, but Nate's RNC was so tight there was no way in hell a gassed/rocked McGregor was getting out.t1_d0pef31

Agreed, but the seconds can be counted, but the decision can be fleeting. So the game goes...t1_d0pczzo

Had a dream she was still fighting Ronda t1_d0pcob7
7
You couldn't pick a better quote to throw back in his face. This is *exactly* what happened.

Before the fight, I said Nate would be stupid not to take this fight to the ground - and Nate *is* stupid, so he probably won't. The theory was that Conor hadn't proven he could win a fight on the ground. It was stupid to try to stand with Conor where he's proven he wins fights.

Nate technically won on the ground, but *I* was wrong. Make no mistake: Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor standing up, trading punches. He got the shit punched out of his face and hung in. Conor couldn't hang. Conor got rocked and got desperate. Nate closed the deal.

Nate won this fight as cleanly as a fight can be won. Kudos.t1_d0pd6uq

The way she threw those last two punches with her eyes closed... Still trying to fight I loved it. They were more like flailing her arms forward but I think she was trying to punch.. Just loved that effort.t1_d0pcs3z

To be fair holly never tapped lol t1_d0pcy99

Rewatched it. You can see her left arm (I think) flailing to try and convincingly tap right after that back toss. It wasn't quick enough...she tried to tap though, you can see it. t1_d0pcy99

well, she is the preachers daughter so she probably learned it from those jesus stories.t1_d0pcy99

Ya'll motherfuckers need to take a jiu jitsu class. She tapped (shoulder), John missed it. She went to tap again. Couldn't cause her arms were swirling around, went to tap on John and couldn't cause she had completely lost coordination by that point, then went out. t1_d0pdcyz

That could easily have been interpretted as a shitty attempt to pull off the choke. A tap is not one tap.t1_d0pdcyz

Weidman also tapped when Rockold was chocking him in the first round, but the referee didn't notice as it was very ambiguous.

She's a warrior. Miesha had a pretty good RNC in round 2 and she toughed it out. t1_d0pd5r9
2
She defended the first attempt very intelligently. She rolled to the 'open' side of the choke before Tate could lock it up. This is much harder to finish as the opponent and the floor can obstruct the grips you're able to get.

Why? He fought like three weightclasses up in a nothing match? So he can't beat a guy 3 times his size. He bloodied Nate up pretty bad though. Full credit to him for not going gently into that good night.

You're going to watch a lot of mediocre fights before you see one like this again, if ever.t1_d0pcu24
1
True. MMA is amazing because nobody is invincible. Conor had to know that eventually he his mouth would write a check that his ass couldn't cash.  (...There's something awesome about watching amazing displays of heart put by supposed underdogs.)

Conor ate some humble pie (as well as quite a few jabs) and likely will never gain back the mystique he had before last night. 

But, he still has the featherweight belt to defend and is the first UFC fighter to earn a million dollars inside the cage. His overconfidence and trash talk is what helped him get to that type of payday. t1_d0ptls9

How come? t1_d0pdz1w

Usually slow, a lot of gasping for breath, fights get shuffled alot due to injuries, and is pretty shallow as in not a deep roster and the fighters aren't as technically skilled as some of the guys in lower classes. A lot of KO's though.t1_d0pe1oy
2
Yeah I thought so. I've never actually watched any heavyweight fights, only the lower classes. So there's no heavyweight fighters worth watching? t1_d0pe40z

There were two Mir vs. Nogueira fights so watch both. Mir did some very impressive stuff in those fights. t1_d0pcu24

Not really conor is always humble post fight win or lose.  The pre fight stuff is all hype to sell, nothing will change t1_d0pe40z
5
Well there are quite a few good fighters still in the division, like Dos Santos, Werdum, Velazquez, Hunt, Overeem, Browne... but the fights tend to be plodding and not very "spectacular" if you will.

A few classic heavyweight fights you should check out: Mir v Nogueira, Dos Santos v Velazquez 1 and 2, Lesnar v Herring, Overeem v Lesnar, Couture v Sylvia. Those are the first to come to mind, hopefully other fans can fill out the list.t1_d0pe8ob
1
Freeman vs Mir should be on that list.

Pretty much any Pride fight with heavyweights will be fun to watch. For whatever reason Pride's heavyweight division produced much more exciting fights on average (although there were more squash matches too).t1_d0pe8ob

You conorbots really don't get it. He is at his natural weight at 170 but kept it down to have a height and reach advantage. This, his speed and getting into his opponent's head was what made him win. If you take away what should be irrelewant to MMA he only has his speed. No chin, no ground game.

It wasn't even an early tap. Anyone who says that doesn't roll. And I'm not some big connor fan. That choke was deep under the neck, hands back behind Connors ear. Nate is fuckin legit on the ground, he turned that bone in and squeezed. When it's locked it's locked. The tap wasn't early. That choke was fire. t1_d0pcpfl

That's the whole point. Her image was a "once EVER" fighter as Joe Rogan so stupidly put it. She went and beat Bethe in Brazil. And everyone said "she can do anything" so she got wrapped up in the hype. And she actually believed she could beat Holly at standing. That's 100% ego. Pure vanity. 

Of course she's a competitor, she wouldn't have made it to the olympics/became the champion of the world if she wasn't a competition. But she wasn't obsessed with it. When people obsessed with winning lose they work their ASSES OFF to win again.

Doubt McGregor is dead over this. He didn't lose his title and he's likely still gonna end up getting the title shot that he wanted regardless of this fight.

The argument could be easily made that:

1. He didn't need to take this fight at all.

2. The fight was way way outside of his weight class.

3. The fight had no meaning whatsoever in the grand scheme of things.

Not a McGregor defender here, but this is a totally different situation than Rousey.t1_d0pd1z8

Not outside his weight class. He's a 155er and fought another 155er. Just neither of them cut weight. t1_d0pd1z8

Dude, I think Ronda's antics are as lame as the next person does, but why is it that this sub is so bizarrely obsessed with not giving her credit for anything? You know the new WBM champ? Ronda finished her 2 times with the same technique. The division would have not existed in the UFC without Ronda. She had a 12-0 career of finishes, 11 in the first round. Until Holm, her entire ring time wasn't a 5 round fight. All of this turned a broke ex-Olympian into literally the biggest star EVER in MMA within 24 months. 

That's incredible. She's achieved more than anyone could have ever imagined, and helped the sport grow immensely. She *is* a once ever fighter. Her brain is completely delusional from that. 

If you think Ronda is the first fighter that cried and considered suicide after losing a fight, you're not living in reality. Her career, the people she inspired, her entire world was shattered in 7 minutes. She went from being a hero to a punchline. 

So yeah, Ronda is annoying. She's acted like a 12 year old and made me cringe as much as anyone else. Her coach should be working at a convenience store in Brooklyn selling counterfeit lotto tickets. But for fuck's sake, let's give credit where it's due. She's not even cleared to train yet. t1_d0pd1z8

Conor has always been very hittable despite his reach. There was actually a post earlier today(I think Cruz breaking down the fight?) where McGregor relying on his chin too much was mentioned. I think he did that this fight. He was confident that he could evade most shots and take those he couldn't.

He always talks about his opponents not respecting his power but, IMO, he has always done the same. I appreciate him trying to put on entertaining fights but in the future I see him being more patient and advancing less. t1_d0pcvwo

Interestingly, Cruz said it was too early to tell whether Conor relied on his chin too much. I guess we know the answer now, though.t1_d0pfnem

He went from 145 -> 155 -- his natural weight class. He fought another 155er, it's just that neither of them cut weight. Let's not get it twisted and think he fought a welterweight fighter. t1_d0pdxpi

As a Conor fan I had hope he'd be able to move up to this weight class and win just like Floyd Mayweather did. But after watching this fight I don't see anyway he can be competitive at this weight. He was too small, to weak. He exploited the cuttability (I know that's not a word) of Diaz yet wasn't able to put him away even though he was bleeding like a stuck pig. He should stick to the lower weights I feel. t1_d0pj87c

you mean like the shit talking that Ali did that brought in fans? shit talking brings attention from media and exposure, people want to see what is going on and may become fans.

it pisses off purists but it expands the casual interest who may become more serious fans. IMO no attention is bad attention  its all goodt1_d0pklgp

I highly doubt that. You think fans, casual or not, will just root for whoever won last? Nah. 

We'll see the numbers in McGregor's next PPV and know how many have stuck with him. My bet is, it will be lower than this one. t1_d0plu0a
1
I mean this politely, but, no shit! Unless he established himself as a dominant 145 champ or became the first dual title holder, of course the next ppv after his eventual first ufc loss will do less numbers. t1_d0pmi56
1
If he won the numbers would be bigger, because of the hype, but since the hype has dwindled, the 'casual' fans he 'brought in' are leaving in droves. Which is my original point: doing big numbers doesn't make you automatically "good for the sport". Conor is good for the promoter's pockets, he hasn't done shit for the sport. t1_d0pmlcl

Conor is great of the sport. People love him & love to hate him. The UFC needs more guys like Conor who can hype a fight. In less than two weeks Conor and Nate managed to build a lot of tension and interest in the fight. 

There has been a lot of headline fights that come and go with little interest because the fighters don't know how to or don't want to hype their fights. Now fighters line up for McGregor because he is a one man marketing machine. Any fight with Conor is a tonne of exposure and money. t1_d0pm0z5
1
The fact he brings in big numbers makes him good for the promoter's bank account, it doesn't make him 'good for the sport'. 

Conor is a striker with no ground game who got himself a title shot by yapping his mouth, KO'd the most dominant champion in activity with a lucky shot, tried to bid for another title in the same manner and ended up getting submitted by a guy who got dominated by the champion he was trying to fight in the first place. 

HOW the FOCK is that good for the sport? t1_d0pmt8v
2
People paying for PPV is good for the sport. Money is good for the sport. UFC doesn't give a shit about Aldo because he can't sell a ticket -- the PPV buy numbers don't lie. 

The bottom line is if people aren't going to pay then athletes won't go pro or go to boxing, promoters will do other things, and the MMA scene will be a stale place. Money matters. 

Also, I think you really underestimate Conor. He had a 15 fight win streak -- he didn't win that by running his mouth, no matter how easy those fights might of been. That hit on Aldo wasn't lucky, that was Aldo showing how shit he is at boxing. He was dominate because no one could check his aggression, Conor checked his aggression.

Diaz wasnt a stupid idiot like Aldo. He boxed, took his hits, established his game, and waited for his spot. Conor was the idiot and started to clown because he wasn't winning like he thought he would and got put down.

Dude, you casual fans will never get it. Watch Aldo's fights and Nate's fights. Aldo is 50 times the fighter that Nate is in his best day. Conor is a joke and a cautionary tale as to why title shots shouldn't be given out like coupons. t1_d0pmt8v
3
>  it doesn't make him 'good for the sport'.

how are you defining "good for the sport?"

fighters need money, money comes from viewers and fans.

 fans range from hardcore fans to casual fans. Expanding the casual fan base will naturally expand the hardcore fan base but getting those casual fans in the door is the hard part. Interest has to be created because casual fans are not really interested in the technical skills but more the drama of the fight the more new viewers the more hard core fan base will expand.

McGregor knows exactly what he is doing, and it works. Look at how popular he has become. He talks all the shit in the world before the fight, but gives respect to his opponent whether he wins or loses. The thing is even though he lost that fight he still has his title belt and made a lot of money, so it was a win-win for him. t3_4965yf
68
I could see that coming, from early in the second round onwards.

Conor was teeing off on Diaz's face for 5 minutes in the 1st, fighting at his own pace. Tearing up Diaz's face, pinging punches off his head, swinging for the fences. He was comfortable, too comfortable.

But Diaz was still in there.

Conor looked too self-assured, got too relaxed, showed too much of his chin to Diaz in his overconfidence that Diaz didn't pose enough of a threat to him in return. He thought he had Diaz right where he wanted him, but then Diaz rode out the storm, Conor tired very quickly, and in his over confidence was caught flush on the chin with a counter and seriously rocked.

And at that moment the fight completely swung.

He never recovered from that punch, and it seemed it was exacerbated by fatigue.

They then clinched for a bit, Conor still took punches against the fence in the clinch, and clearly still hadn't recovered. Once they broke he took more straightforward punches in the exchange, his elusiveness was completely gone, he was right on the edge of being ko'd still, and in desperation he tried to take Diaz down.

It was a lame effort, he was as good as done. Diaz defended it, mounted him, caught him with a few punches, Conor showed his back half out cold, and Diaz ended it with the rear naked choke.

I think what this fight showed is that Conor had never had someone eat those kind of punches, and keep coming back for more. His power didn't translate to 170lbs from 145lbs. And he hadn't accounted for that. His overconfidence that Diaz would eventually succumb, and didn't pose much of a threat in return, really cost him as he faded with fatigue in a completely alien place of expending himself that much and his opponent not going down.

Don't think he should be fighting at 170t1_d0pdtrw
0
This is exactly what I called last week. You can't throw a 5'9" guy who normally competes at 145 into a fight against a 6'0" guy at 170 and expect much of anything.

At 6'0", 170lbs is still very lean. 170lbs is bordering on fat for somebody McGregor's height. t1_d0pejrd
2
Conor is a natural lightweight, not a featherweight, and that last night as Rogan rightly put it 'was two lightweights fighting without a water cut'. 

Rafael dos Anjos is 5"9. GSP is only 1" taller at 5.10". Conor was fighting guys that he was a 3-4 inches taller over before. For example Mendes is 5.6"

 I think Conor now needs to go back to featherweight, and start defending his title, or get inline in the lightweight division. t1_d0pdtrw
1
> Don't think he should be fighting at 170

Nate doesn't fight at 170 normally either.

He normally fights 155.t1_d0pdtrw
1
I agree with most of that, and I like your writing, but I disagree on two fundamental points:

a) The fight was a lightweight fight really - just one where there wasn't a weight cut. This is really important to note for 2 reasons:

- 1) A real 170-pounder (think someone like Lawler or Condit) would be at least 15-20 pounds (of mostly muscle) heavier at fight time than Diaz and McGregor were there, and in many cases be taller and longer than Diaz. It's not Conor's power (and chin) doesn't translate to 170, it's that it doesn't translate as well to *155*. Actual 170 pound guys would hurt him badly in most cases. His 170 pound ambitions are done unless he can put a lot of muscle on and develop a fighting style that works as a guy who is small for the division. 

- 2) This is a huge issue for Conor as he is struggling to make 145 and is assuming he'll do really well at 155. Now Nate has a very, very good chin but this has to put serious doubt in his mind as to whether he can even thrive at 155.  Conor may have a bright future or he may be a more or less spent force now and fade rapidly as he becomes unable to cut to 145 where he has a size advantage and is just a gatekeeper at 155.

b) Nate landed quite a few solid jabs (and the famous Stockton slap) in round 1 - it wasn't as one-sided as it looked. Those jabs may not look like much but they rattle and tire the opponent and the Diaz brothers have made a career based off of them. Certainly Nate laid enough damage down in round 1 to start slowing Conor down in round 2 so that he could start landing the 1-2s that broke Conor.t1_d0pdtrw

watch the first round again. Diaz is landing a lot on Conor. Its not flashy and they aren't hay makers, they are super accuarate shots catching conor coming in.t1_d0pdtrw

Ok. t1_d0pdtrw
1
You nailed it. Great summary.t1_d0pdtrw
1
Nicely put view. But I think you are playing too much into this all being down to Conor being overconfident. Nate fought awesome in there, and he beat Conor by being the better fighter. 

> Don't think he should be fighting at 170

As Joe nicely put, it was 'two lightweights fighting without the water cut'. I can see a lot of people saying '170' was too much of a jump for Conor, which is wrong. Conor is natural a lightweight, you can see that in how he near on kills himself getting down to featherweight. t1_d0pdtrw
1
Spot on mate. 

One thing I would add is that he didn't keep his fucking dukes up at all in the second. 

His style, his fatigue, and his over confidence that Diazs punches weren't super powerful were probably why.t1_d0pcu24
2
I'm guessing Conor knew he would lose eventually and is better prepared than Rousey to rebound, but who knows.

Big fat slice of humble pie either way.t1_d0pf4aa

The strangest thing is McGregor has said himself precision beats power and the Diaz Bros are known for their high level boxing. It's weird that he underestimated him. I guess that's what hype does to a person though.t1_d0pdtrw
1
I agree, but I'll add that Nate is a lightweight, he last fought at 155. He hasn't been a true welterweight in a long time.t1_d0pdtrw
2
> He never recovered from that punch, and it seemed it was exacerbated by fatigue.

Lot of people missing this. After that punch, it was over. He was nearly out on his feet, badly rocked and not recovering.

I'd also add that his range was way off the entire fight - his big lefts, which he threw repeatedly early on, almost all hit air just in front of Diaz' face. It wasn't like Diaz had great head movement either, I think Conor just didn't have enough experience fighting a bigger longer man and wasn't able to adapt and the air punches gassed him.t1_d0pdtrw
2
Well said i think if anyone at 145 takes the abuse Nate did in the first round they are down and out and Connor takes the win.  His power just didn't hold up and he had nothing else to offer, especially after he gassed.t1_d0pdtrw

I got so much shit for saying this isn't the first "Conor" we've seen a few days ago. Dude saying so much shit, but really having very few legit Top 10 fights to his record, and then he comes in against a dude that is flat out not scared of him and has physical advantages and it's a different story entirely. Conor's not the first, and he won't be the last.t3_4965yf

Say what you want about McGregor's antics in the build up to this fight and his strategy during it, but I have to give him credit for being willing to take risks like he does. This is the type of thing fight fans wanted to see out of GSP for his entire career and never did. This won't be the last time we see McGregor do something like this, and for that I am thankful because it makes the UFC so much more exciting.t1_d0pcwdw

1
Good comment, I certainly respect Conor for al the hype and excitement he's been able to generate. However, I have a feeling that before fighting at a higher weight again he'll have to clean out his division and fight Edgar, or at least not have a clear contender for the belt.  

It was risky what he did, moving up. Crazy fun though. Imagine if he managed to win? t1_d0pcwdw
4
Yeah I agree. I think he just needs to fix a few things which I believe he's humble enough to properly assess unlike Ronda. He quite clearly won the first round so it shows he can hang up there. Just has to account for different variables. t1_d0pcwdw
5
Nah, people wanted GSP to go up to middleweight where he would be seriously out sized by Anderson.

This was literally two lightweight fighters fighting without cutting water. Conor was actually going to be taller and longer reach than RDA. We also saw from the weigh ins that he was just as girthy as Nate.t1_d0pdbwe
3
Conor and RDA are the same exact height. t1_d0pcwdw
3
People hate on the guy for being cocky, but he's generally a good fighter and he's only cocky to sell fights and to entertain. His fights are always hype as fuck becuase he's hyped them up. He racks up the attendance and the audiences and he gets everybody talking about him and the fights. He is an entertainer, and he's a pretty good fighter to boot.t1_d0ph7xh

he got exposed tonight. Back to fighting midgets for him, without a huge size advantage he's garbage.t1_d0pilju

He has always acted like a arsehole why are you only now losing faith? t1_d0pdm53
1
im not losing faith, i just think he acted differently this time around, I fell in love with conor for the confidence, the smooth talking, and that crazy high pitched laugh he does. He just seemed like an asshole this time, made it less about himself and more about jabs towards nate. Compare his RDA presser to the Diaz one, he was wearing a wild shirt calling himself el chapo and all that, to diaz, making fun of him for teaching kids ju jitsu, he just seemed out of charactert1_d0pcz9b

Dude, he is fucking acting that way to make huge amounts of cash. He has made the sport even bigger doing what he does, with his unique personality.

No, before he would say how hes the best, talk about himself. this go around, he mocked a guy for teaching kids martial arts,swung at nate at the face off, and got personal.

I think he got Aldo'd and got emotionally invested in this in the buildup. The cold calculated swag filled Irishman I fell in love with wasnt there leading up to the fight, and he wasnt in that octagon tonight. Conor fought impulsively, and tried to brawl with a guy with longer reach, more height, and a tougher chin. At least I didnt have to watch conor get TKO'd. I dont think I could handle seeing that :(t1_d0pdfhx

Maybe, I think the part that was worst was that Diaz was on the very end of his punches, none landed that clean, and whilst doing that kept his hands down and ate all of the return fire.
You can't stand and take punches, not from anybody. t1_d0pdjko
1
yeah, i think he found out the hard way that not everyone is a chad mendes, you dont get to purposely put your hands down and try to eat punches. Well, unless you're robbie lawler (speaking of, i now think he'd also give conor hell)t1_d0pdraf

He was taking less punches with Chad, and Nate obviously hits harder. Robbie certainly would, though I expect Conor to bounce back.t1_d0pd365

Nah I don't think it'll be that bad. McGregor clowns around more, Ronda was genuinely mean-spirited and cunty plenty of times. Most people know Conor is doing it to hype himself up. He'll face a backlash, but I don't think it'll be that bad. t1_d0pctnu

I'm no expert, but that's what it looked like. Knew he couldn't clinch to get some rest so he went for the take down. t1_d0pctnu

Maybe a combination of the two. He was throwing crazy heat in the first which definitely wore him out. Then that one two landed perfectly on the chin. Being dazed in addition to being tired is a scary thing in a fight. t1_d0pctnu

He was gassed from throwing stupid wild punches and standing in the pocket leting Nate light him up, weirdest fucking thing I have seen him do. Completely deserved the loss after that second round display. His first round was much better, but he was still very wasteful with wild swinging and not respecting Nate's power.t1_d0pctnu

He was definitely rocked a little while before he decided to go for the take down.  Just seemed like Conor decided after a few more shots that he had to do *something*t1_d0pd40i

IMO it's not even close to rousey level. He will get a lot of shit but he will fall back on the out of weight class line. Better believe he won't be fighting at 170 anymore. He still has the belt. 

Plus holms was like +1000 for that fight. Nate was an underdog but only around +350 I believe. t1_d0pctnu

y would he try to take the fight to the ground with a bjj black belt?t1_d0pcyns
2
Basically he needed a break from the punches and hoped to gain some time by getting Nate on the ground. He's not good enough at wrestling/bjj and/or he was too rocked to do anything so Diaz demolished him.t1_d0pcyns

Because he got punched in the face and was on queer street.t1_d0pctnu

He got rocked by Diaz and became a panicked wrestler, that's what happened.t1_d0pcxi6

I thought if he waited it out for the last minute, Conor would have been fine. Shooting the legs when you're not a wrestler was such a panic move. Once he did that, I knew it was over. t1_d0pd03j
5
Nah mcg was being outclassed on his feet at that point. If McGregor didn't shoot, he would have been knocked out eventually.
He expended a lot of energy trying to ko Nate 1st round, and Nate would have just 50% punched his face all day (the Diaz brothers have been known to go 5 rounds looking like they could go 10 more).t1_d0pctnu

We have never seen Conor get tagged like that. He was legit rocked and Maybe it was just me but you could see his confidence fade and him go "shit I messed up"

P.s. This is why I love mma what a night. You never know what is going to happen. It can go either way on any night! t1_d0pcykv

I don't think Conor's ever been rocked. If he'd had some experience with it before it may have helped. Against someone as accurate as Nate you're going to get fucked up.t1_d0pcykv
1
This is the funny thing. It happens in a lot of fighting sports, and happened very recently in Boxing with Anthony Joshua. A guy comes in, wrecks the scene with easy wins and everybody jumps on their shit (I love Conor, i think he's awesome, by the way). In none of those fights were they really tested. Yes, maybe that's because they are so good that the fight is usually over before they get a big one to the jawbone, but you can't sit back and expect your man to comfortably beat everybody when he hasn't het been properly lamped in the face.

Luckily when AJ got hit hard he kept his head and pulled through and still won, so i wasn't too heartbroken by it. Unfortunately Conor seems to have no idea how to handle taking a big shot from a guy used to fighting heavier guys than him and once that landed the fight was over. I did not see Conor ever coming back from that.t1_d0pcykv

he got rocked by one of Nate's punches and then got lit up for like 30 seconds after that. It looked like he shot out of desperation because he'd get knocked out if he didn't.t1_d0pcz9m

I also think he was gassed leading up to that punch that rocked him. He was getting sloppy at the start of the second. Wasn't as mobile. His head movement slowed and he didn't compensate with proper defense. t1_d0pdrwp

She definitely tapped the shoulder. Twice, if I recall correctly. John just missed it because they were a bit half-assed. 

EDIT: Just rewatched the gif. She does a half ass tap (very very very very close to a fake tap...) moments after meisha lands on her back. Because John does not stop there, she goes a couple seconds longer then tries to tap again, but goes out in the middle of the action, causing her arms to flail.

1
RNC and an arm triangle are different feeling chokes.t1_d0pd14n
2
>Conor has mentioned in prior interviews how his biggest regret in life was tapping to the arm triangle choke Joe Duffy caught him in, and how he would never tap to a choke again.

Link?t1_d0pd14n
4
I think it's a natural reaction and not something people can ever truly train for. You don't know how you're going to react until you're being choked out.

Also, I think he wanted out of the fight anyways, hence why he shot... pure desperation.t1_d0pdtz8
1
That's more the point than the speed of the tap to me - he gave his back up very easily and pretty much gave Nate his neck on a plate. He wanted out of that fight. That's the real victory for Nate - he didn't just beat Conor, he broke his will.t1_d0pg99i

I'm not sure why the speed of his tap is even relevant. That rear naked was in too deep and he knew he wasn't getting out. 

What honour is there in not tapping?t1_d0pgdzr

None. People need to take some bjj classes and learn what it's like to sink a deep RNC.t1_d0pppri

I agree. I actually have been doing no gi bjj since November and yeah, when a black belt gets that RNC in it's in. t1_d0pd14n

I reckon this is different. Conor and Nate gave it back and fourth but Ronda had no real reason to act the way she did which is why i think there was so much backlash at her.

also conor showed some good sportsmanship in the end of it all. Ronda didn't show shit and is still sooking about itt3_4965yf

Once again Diaz & Miesha show us that it is important to have ground game, not just take down defense.t1_d0pdmoy

Conor has a ground game. His defense of Chad's choke was great. Just Nate's BJJ is elite.t1_d0pdo1i
1
Connor was already out of his mind, had nothing to do with elite ju jitsu skills.t1_d0pdqj4
2
Yeah maybe sot1_d0pdo1i

yeah, Conor's flat starfish like guard against Mendes was brilliant. you need to have more than one smart guillotine escape in order to constitute a "game".
t1_d0pdqdp
1
Well Chad was the best wrestler in the division.t1_d0pdrzr
1
that still doesn't negate the sheer thought of moving your hips in closed guard. if Conor was using his hips and then Mendes was recentering him and keeping him flat, i would agree with you but Conor didn't initiate anything from closed guard. even in open workouts Conor would do weird stuff during grappling sessions that were just technical errors.

Die hard McGreggor fan here. He makes every Irishman across the world proud to be Irish. Tonight is nothing but respect to Nate. He flat exposed my hero tonight. He tagged him took him down and went to work. Nate's BJJ is just different and it was an amazing fight. I'm sad and disappointed but as a MMA fan I can't be upset t1_d0pdqpw
1
Nate didn't take Connor down - that's important. Connor was desperate and shot for the takedown, and then Nate went to work. Nate stood and traded with him until Connor couldn't do it anymore.

That aside - it was one hell of a fight. Fantastic show by both fighters - I'm excited to see where Connor goes from here, and I'm even more excited about Nate getting the recognition he deserves. I think he's often overshadowed by Nick, but this fight should hopefully help him overcome that a bit more.t1_d0pmp18
1
It may be semantics but he did get taken down. Conor got tagged and went for a double. Nate blocked it, flicked his hips and Conor went down. t1_d0pdqpw
1
I also love McGregor. I was butt hurt by his loss but people quickly forget how keen his reflex and striking is. I'm hoping in the future he respects his opponent's capabilities and use it to his advantage,  just like Anderson Silva did when he dismantled Nick Diaz. t1_d0pdqpw

Conor didn't have to fight but he took it anyway and at 170, you have to respect that, unlike Jon Jones who always steps down when his opponents have to pool out.t1_d0ph1sw

depends on your interests. conor knows that there's a fine line between cocky and delusional and mean and he walks it well for his imaget1_d0pdan4

I got mad respect for Connor. Im glad he lost. But he really had nothing to gain by taking this fight except fam and $$$. He could easily have taken a little time off and waited for RDA. Interesting to see how things go from here t1_d0pdan4

Jones has pulled out when he's risking his title, this was just a catch-weight bout that ultimately means nothing. It's not really the same thing.t1_d0pdan4

I think Nate is very much in between. I think he suffers cutting to 155 where Conor would be 100%. His length made it really hard for McGregor and Nate is much taller than RDAt1_d0perql

A loss is always pretty devastating, it's almost natural to carry on lik Ronda did after one, especially won like this. He was all class after the fight.

I suppose it is easier to fake humility after a win is more the thing, but McGregor is genuinely humble. UNLESS he is promoting a fight.t1_d0pcoyl

I am so happy for Nate as i've been a fan of the Diaz brothers for a long time. But i don't understand the hate for Conor? Does he talk a lot, sure does, but he also fights very often and is a very entertaining fighter overall. I remember how much people shit on Anderson and Ronda when they lost (although i totally get the Ronda hate), it's a fighting sport, people lose.

I'll always like watching guys like Cowboy and Conor. They fight often, they are skilled and very fun to watch, win or lose.t3_4965yf

I didnt think that but I had a real bad feeling about Conor. Felt like he was going overboard with the showmanship the last few days, in contrast to the Aldo fight where he was in "a state of zen" and didnt say nothing pre-fight press conference. He was way too cocky for this fight.t3_4965yf

Conor looked real sloppy from the beginning.t1_d0pcoil
1
Not really.. A lesser man than diaz would have been finished by the shots he took from Conort1_d0pg99i
11
He's absolutely massive for 145 and puts himself near death to make that cut. In his previous promotion he was the 155lb champion. So, yes -- his natural weight class is the 155lbs division.t1_d0pe1y7
31
Yeah, he respected the other fighter when he won. Just like he respected Nate heret1_d0pcoil
1
No, he didn't. He was fast and he won round 1 pretty decisively though it was competitive.

It's like Nate said, he just needed some time to get into it, and once he did, he outboxed McGregor.

Let's not make excuses for McGregor. He's a great fighter and doesn't need it.t1_d0pcoil
1
I thought he looked good.  He was blasting Nate with that overhand left over and over again in the first.  t1_d0pcoil
1
Yeah there were some wild swings from McGregor. That reach discrepancy made it hard to dictate where he could land those punches, especially vs southpawt1_d0pcoil
1
In the beginning of the first he looked crisp and energetic while Nate looked slow. Conor put himself up enough with the early damage that he had no excuse to go out like he did.t1_d0pcoil

He under estimated Nate from the get got1_d0pcoil

He didn't respect Diaz's power. Plain and simple. He was catching Nate all of round 1 and early round 2 but he got way too comfortable for his own good. t1_d0pcoil

His main punch was the overhand left that missed half the time. Plus with all the missed punches, you can see that he over committed on those punches.t1_d0pcoil

First round he was looking pretty fucking good, what you talking about? Nate's face all bloodied up lolt1_d0pcoil

I disagree. He was timing his cross counter perfectly in the first. He threw with a little too much heat though and was visibly tired in the 2nd. Then that 1-2 landed on the chin and it was all over. t1_d0pcoil

Yea, I think so. He came out getting hit a lot in the second. Said something about not conserving his oxygen correctly. I hated Mcgregor before the fight, but after tonight I think I'm a fan now. Dude is fucking game. t1_d0peij1

lol good sport he was walking around calling RDA's broken foot a bruise. matter of fact he called Werdum a pussy for canceling his fight cause he got injured.t1_d0pcoil

actually he looked pretty good till he got ROCKED on the chin in the second round. after that it was all a snowball effect of trying to claw back with wobbly legs and slow reflexes. t1_d0pcwhx
1
It looked like it was just a matter of time in the first round and then he let it get to his head that he was invincible in the second. Disappointing showingt1_d0pcwhx
1
I think everyone is just used to McGregor being dominant. So when hes barely winning he looks terrible.t1_d0pcwhx
1
It all started when he actually landed a lot on Nate and Nate started covering up. McGregor got super confident and just started throwing sloppy punches and that's when Nate caught him.t1_d0pcwhx
3
> actually he looked pretty good till he got ROCKED on the chin in the second round.

Even before that moment, he was often staying in with his hands down and his head still after he threw his punches.  The whole fight, Nate had been landing some good shots in response.  Conor didn't seem to care and he didn't adjust.  Seemed only concerned with his offense.  And then it started happening before he threw his punches, too.  He spent some time just hanging out in punching range, taking some good shots at times.  And he still didn't seem like he cared.

Yes, he was winning before that shot landed in the second.  But I thought he looked a bit wild and sloppy on offense at times, and was often very careless about getting hit in return.  The strikes on him were starting to add up.  He couldn't have taken the shots over 5 rounds, and would have HAD to finish Nate before he got finished himself.

And that's a BAD way to fight a Diaz.t1_d0pcwhx
3
But even before that he was crazy tired. He dumped all his chips into that first round OK.t1_d0pcwhx
3
Yeah he looked sharp and fast, but I think he was having trouble with Nates range. He whiffed a lot of punches.t1_d0pcwhx
5
You're exactly right. Solid until the 2nd round. He got sloppy and cocky real quick. I'm a McGregor  fan and I can admit that. t1_d0pcwhx

Yeah, I don't know what these people are talking about. In the first round, his head movement was crazy good and he caught Nate A LOT. Nate has a damn good chint1_d0pd1xe

10
The concept isn't lost on me, but Nate was nowhere near rolling with those punches in the first round, what fight were you watching?t1_d0pec17
1
Yeah, his head was snapping back quite often. The concept of having a fucking monster chin is what Nate used to survive the first.t1_d0pd1xe
4
> ROCK

Agreed... I was rooting for Nate but wasn't too happy with Rd 1, McG looked damn good out there. That left was connecting at will... now granted Nate didn't have much time to prepare, but still... he slipped shots and connected hard with the left over and over... He looked good, patient, accurate.

If anything, I think Conor overestimated how easy this would be, and at the same time highly underestimated the power that guys carry at 155/170 compared to FW. But I'm excited for Conor vs RDA/Ferguson/Khabib/Pettis/Nate II etc. 155 will be good for him and for us.t1_d0pd1xe
5
He was winging power punches and spinning kicks. For every punch he landed he was missing a bunch and he was getting tagged. By the time he got to the second he started gassing out.t1_d0pd1xe
3
He was swinging for the fences with every punch. He might have realized it in his post-fight when he said he wasn't energy efficient in the first.t1_d0pj05s
-1
yeah that one clip ignores all the pre-hype build up, the two times he snatched aldo's belt telling Aldo he was going to die, putting his hands on Aldo's shoulders, running at him in the crowd after the Dennis silver fight claiming he bounced Aldo's head off the canvas during the 196 prefight conference. How about Calling out two heavy weight champions for pulling out of a fight because they were injured. Even before 196 Mcgregor was still calling Aldo a pussy for pulling out the first time for a broken rib.

Not disrepectful? LOL the guy took over the post fight conference after beating Aldo walking around claiming he was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 best pound for pound and then DJ and JBJ is somewhere behind him.t1_d0pcoil

I think he thought Diaz would do the same thing as Mendes: gas out after two because of short notice, then he would just be able to drop him. t1_d0pdbeg

I honestly think he underrated Diaz, that dude can fight and his chin is a block of steel. Hopefully Conor will get a bit more respectful because he now clearly isn't the best fighter. If he calls it a fluke, we call the Aldo fight a fluke. t1_d0pcr56

Shame that dominant mma fighters get so cocky. I mean, watch the tape on Nate at least. He's not a guy you're going to dominate standing or on the ground. It's going to be a fucking war.

Conor didn't respect his opponent enough. t1_d0pcsay
1
Yeah the one thing I liked about Conor was that even with all the shit talk he never believed his own hype in the octagon.  He always took fights seriously...until today.  Hope this is a wake up call for him and he comes back a better fighter.t1_d0pdbm7

The Mendes fight was the eye opener.

Guy thinks he has young dan henderson/32yo Anderson Silva chin, was a matter of time. Hilariously it only took one single opponent his own size/bigger on a 10 day notice to stun him, lmfao.t1_d0pcvk9
25
It's been his biggest criticism throughout his career.

When he hits you, you generally hit him. He just tends to hit you a lot fucking harder.

When you aren't towering over your opponents, suddenly trading shots changes.

Despite all the circlejerk reverbs tonight I thought he started well, his left straight was moving so fucking fast, if they had clipped Nate just a little more square rather than cutting him, that would have been it I think.

But it didn't happen and Nate just added another page to the "if you try to stand and bang with a Diaz you will lose" mythos. t1_d0pdaa4
4
He did start well, the first round was a good round for him. Started the second ok too but then he got hit with a few hard shots and slowed down. He didn't gas as I've seen people say, he was getting tagged t1_d0pdaa4
5
Definitely agree with that, I don't understand the comments about mcgregor having a sloppy first round. He was throwing good punches but too overconfident in his stancet1_d0pdbm7
1
I'm a Diaz dick rider but I was still a huge McGregor fan. I didn't think it was possible, but I became even more of a fan of McGregor watching him post fight. No excuses and very accurate with his post fight assessment. t3_4965yf

McGregor needed to clear his head after being rocked but showed inexperience in that regard (don't think he'd been hurt by punches in his entire career) and pushed forward instead, and Nate poured on the pressure. He needed to fight a much more disciplined fight when he's not the bigger guy.t3_4965yf

Conor's defense was non-existentt1_d0pcvyr

As opposed to what? He fought like he always does, but just against someone who kept moving forward and avoided his left hand. t1_d0pdtzb
1
 well, if you noticed the right side of nates face he clearly did not avoid them, looked like he preferred to eat them.t1_d0pdbm7
5
At the end of the day, he also jumped to 170 from 145. Nate is a 155'er with no camp, but Conor won't lose respect for the loss from true fans. His shit talking is what got him as high up as he went as fast, and he had balls to take on any fighter. Respect but I couldn't be happier about the result. t1_d0pef12
2
He got caught a few times, but he didn't dive into them and get countered. Conor had to land it from the outside while he was moving away from it.  t3_4965yf

I don't think McGregor's faced a guy with a chin like Diaz's and his length was a problem. I gave the first round to Conor but you definitely don't want to go to the ground with a Gracie black beltt1_d0pcw07

Honestly, if you go to the ground with any black-belt, you've got a better shot if it's a Gracie black-belt. (Unless it's an actual Gracie.)t1_d0pe88x

lol wut?t1_d0pekdh
1
Gracie Academy is not a very well respected system in a lot of BJJ circles now. The family is super talented, but their system has become more about profits than skill. My response was more sarcastic than anything, because a blackbelt has already proven themselves time and again, but the lower belt students in the Gracie system usually don't stack up very well.t1_d0pen8w

I see what you're saying, but big difference between getting a gracie academy blue belt online and being a 7 year black belt under cesar gracie.t1_d0pg1zx

I agree, Conor plays his role to make the money which is obvious, he knows being a heel brings in the views. Ronda seemed to truly believe all her shit and still claims she is undefeated.....Conor is aware of what he does where as Ronda is just extremely flawed as a person.t3_4965yf

1
That's it. I think biggest thing in this fight was Nates chin. Conor busted his gas tank on that. When he had no more energy to slip he was lit up with Nates boxing. It was over when he got wobbled the first time.t1_d0pdxoh
10
Don't forget aldo was also rushing forward. Conor did time it really well, but that Aldo knockout wasn't all raw Conor power, it was helped along by Aldo's forward momentum. t1_d0pe461
1
Very true. This is why the shot was hard to pick up when we were watching live. Wasn't a power shot from Conor, but acted as one due to Jose moving forward and Conor hitting him flush.t1_d0penwl

Yep, á la Anderson Silva style. I kept trying to tell my friend who kept riding Conor's hype train that the Aldo KO was a fluke win, and it wouldn't win if they fought 100 times. He told me I was wrong. He has since disappeared, I wonder why :)t3_4965yf

After Nate took several of Conor's punches... You could see the confidence from McGregor slipping away. People always say knockout artists lose confidence when they can't knock a guy out... I think we saw that in Conor tonight.

Also, he wasn't using any kicks and just throwing the left hand and simple one two's over and over again. Was being very predictable.t3_4965yf

For Conor, hopefully he see's this as a stepping stone. Props for him for moving up to two weight classes in 11 days. But this just shows that in the MMA you can never underestimate your opponent.

This. Humble in defeat. Going back down to 45 to defend the belt and he can say : " I went up to 170 to fight while you bums waited for me." I love Connor, but I was not surprised by this. Nate's boxing and Bjj were so overlooked. t3_4965yf
8
If you pay attention to what each fighter said in their post fight interview you will notice their fight strategy. McGregor said he didn't manage his energy well, and that he was ineficcient, while Nate said he started slow because he had no camp, but then started to get better rythm during the fight.

To me, McGregor's plan was to KO Nate during the first 2 rounds, while Nate's was to hold his ground until he could get going. Nate's was sucessful. 

I think if McGregor don't K.O. people early, he will end up losing. That's why Aldo rushing up to him was such a bad move. It also makes sense with his trash talking attitude, making people want to rush you down and coming at you, so you can land a big counterhit, otherwise McGregor would have to fight slow and probably gas out.t3_4965yf

Yeah, there is a reason guys dont go up two weight classes in 3 months.  Nate clearly hit a hell of a lot harder than conor expected.  Not to mention the fact that conor looked slow as hell at 168.  I'm guessing nobody makes that mistake again for a long, long time.t3_4965yf

I've been here a long time and always appreciated that. I work Saturday nights and often don't get to watch PPVs until Sunday. R/videos and r/sports spoiled the results for this fight and some others in the past for me and it really takes a lot of the fun and excitement out of things. I don't see why they also act like it's crazy when people ask for things to be spoiler tagged either. This is one of biggest fights of the year. I don't see how it's any different from Star Wars spoilers, or Fallout 4 spoilers, etc. They would be pissed if people spoiled those for them but somehow they can't grasp how a huge fight being spoiled is a problem. t3_4965yf

I thought Connor would probably win but really wanted Nate to stop the hype train. This could not have ended any better. Connor had to beg for mercy. That's better than a knockout in my opinion. He quit on Nate on national television after talking all his usual over the top bullshit. So awesome.t1_d0pt4ff

IMO Conor will probably become a better fighter after this.t1_d0pcq45

If he takes from this and learns he will for sure.. If he goes the Ronda way of dealing with her loss.. not so much.

I personally think Connor will go back and work at it even harder and he will come back even stronger. I look forward to seeing what he will do in the next year.t1_d0pcq45

I don't know. In theory he should, but his ego and "legend" was also as powerful of a tool as his left hand.

He won the first round not even close. But he got way too cocky, thought every round would be so easy. Nate wasn't ready to quit though. t1_d0pcouy

he was definitely winning. He tried to slip the jab but nate had the 1-2 ready. When conors head came back to position he got cracked.t1_d0pcouy

He was putting out way way too much power.  I knew Nate was going to wear him down and finish him if Connor didnt put him down in the first round.  t1_d0pcouy

he did win the first round. but the 2nd round he got tagged once and it just went downhill so so fast. I felt like Diaz smelled blood once he saw conor was dazed. diaz went super saiyant1_d0pcwx5

This is why weight classes exists and why conor needs to stay off the red meat and stay at featherweight. The top 5 lightweights will all smoke him. And God forbid that nonsense he was talking about welterweight. Lawler or Rory would, it would be a dismantling. t1_d0pdm8a

 I mean,  Nate Diaz is a lightweight fighter.  He got wrecked as a welter. This fight was a welterweight fight in name only.t3_4965yf

I keep telling people, weight classes exist for a reason. And people think Conor would be able to take Robbie Lawler punches? Comon people, size was a huge difference in this fight. Diaz had the length and probably felt stronger punches from people at 155 and 170 who are stronger and bigger than Conor.t3_4965yf

Here is how I look at this fight: Conor learned his lesson. He learned that he can't take these risks anymore. He did something that no one else in modern mma would even consider for a moment. I expect we will now see a McGregor more weary of taking short notice opponents, and a McGregor who no longer speaks of welterweight. Nate Diaz. I expect we just saw the next lightweight champ. Conor will go down and fight (knockout) Edgar. Diaz will fight RDA. I am happy for Diaz, I am sad for Conor. He could have said no when RDA pulled. Anyone else would have. t3_4965yf

Wake up call for McGregor. He needs to go back to basics and fight with a proper gameplan. He's gotten like Anderson Silva of late, showboating and leaving his chin exposed, eating shots. 

With a good gameplan he would likely have won that fight, kicking Nate's legs and moving in when appropriate, instead swinging bombs and gassing himself. Nate was solid and did what he always, took shots and boxed smartly.t3_4965yf
3
People forget that Dos Anjos beat Nate about a year ago even though Nate missed his weight pretty badly and Nate had the reach advantage.t3_4965yf
3
the "moved up 2 weight classes" is a bad excuse for conor. him and nate walk around at pretty much the same weight.. conor just cuts stupid amounts of weight normally so he can beat much smaller opponents (all of his ufc wins were against opponents who had much shorter reach than him, and only 1 of his wins was against a taller opponent). the size disadvantage is a bad excuse, dos anjos is the same height as conor with the same leg reach, and has shorter arm reach.. yet he managed to dominate the lightweight division defeating solid opponents including donald cerrone (twice), ben henderson, champion anthony pettis, and ofcourse nate diaz.t3_4965yf
12
He was gassed in the second. Lauzon called it, the fast weight bulk up killed his cardio. Everyone saying he was being to cocky, trying to be Silva etc.. but it was just his cardio tank. He was on point the first round and outclassed nate, then second round you could see him suddenly start walking around flat footed, big breaths, no more talking etc. He just gassed.t1_d0pd8bi

Funny thing is when this excuse was used on Mendes (which I truly believe was a HUGE factor), people were laughed at... I'm not saying that's what you are doing specifically, just saying people underestimate how bad (due to weight or schedule) cardio management can truly destroy a fighter. I agree with you, it clearly had an impact on Conor, but the weird thing is the impact would've been the same at 155. He didn't bulk up for this fight, he bulked up for RDA.t1_d0pdmxe

I agree it would of been the same outcome with rda, probably worse. He's going to have to figure out how to properly go up weightclasses as whatever he did for this one did not work out.t1_d0pd1za

I'm happy Diaz won too guys but stop making fun of Conor for tapping quickly, this isn't WWE. When you feel it locked in tight and you are not in a position to escape, you have to tap.t1_d0pf717
2
That was a 'I am done' tap. He was too hurt and tried a takedown to recover, felt Nate slide into guard and so rolled over and gave him the back. Very much the opposite of Holm, who lost  by the same, but fought every inch of that choke until she slept.t1_d0pdbk9
1
I mean it's no secret that Conor's game is the standup and Nate's game is on the ground. So when you see Conor initiating a takedown, you know something is wrong.t1_d0pf717

/r/mma is predictably tripping over themselves to bury Conor, but I respect the hell out of him for even taking this fight. Moves up in weight, his opponent pulls out two weeks before the fight, and he goes, "Sure, I'll fight someone else who fights a completely different style."

Most champions would have been too concerned with protecting their reputation/ marketing power. Conor wants to fight everyone. That's an attitude we should celebrate.t1_d0pmj0s

Time to go back to cutting 25, 30 pounds and fighting midgets. t3_4965yf

All the McGregor casuals in here thinking this was a 170lb division that Conor walked into. This was a 155lb fight without cut. Conor would be annihilated at welter weight. He's basically stuck at feather weight now.t3_4965yf
16
Eh honestly not surprised by the outcome after watching round 1.

3 things dictated this loss IMO:

1.) Size advantage, McGregor moving up to fight Nate at 170 definitely favors Nate far more than McGregor. I was already skeptical of McGregor moving up to 155 due to the size difference but he is a big FW but WW is pushing it far too head.

2.) Height advantage: McGregor fights with a long style in which he utilizes reach with straight punches and kicks. Nate's height made that incredibly difficult. A lot of times where McGregor would have normally landed shots Nate was able to move away due to the height difference. Not surprising there.

3.) Connor's defense: I feel Connor's defense is really similar to a fighter that generally has reach advantage where hands down can be okay given the range is usually in their favor. However against Nate, Connor's defense was incredibly weak and he attempted too many weaves and bobs to dodge instead of relying on any defense with his hands. Watching round 1 made me think that eventually Nate would win the war of attrition.

IMO this was a bad matchup for Connor as 1.) He's more of FW/LW. 2.) Nate is a long LW already. 

But Connor sealed his defeat with his cockiness in lowering his hands. Doesn't take away from how good he is but IMO in today's age it's way too difficult to succeed in multiple weight classes. BJ did it when the competition was weaker.
t1_d0pdd5s
2
Yeah, I sarcastically referenced Nostradamus for exactly that reason.
You don't need a crystal ball to know that Connor shooting for a takedown means Connor is desperate, badly hurt, and out of options.

t1_d0pczpn
1
point 1 is incredibly off. He fought a natural 155 without a weight cut.t1_d0q167w
1
I think it's mixed, let's not forget that LW's usually cut from much higher weights and if they haven't been focusing on weight cutting they probably walk around 170-180. A lightweight after losing weight for the fight is still usually 165-170 before weighins. So yes Nate is a natural 155 but his walking weight is likely to be much higher than McGregors IMO. But I could be wrongt1_d0q19v3
1
Nate and Conor are natural 155lb fighters. Nate got ragdolled at 170.t1_d0pczpn
1
It's worth noting that Nate, Barboza and Ferguson are the only top 15 LWs with a longer reach than Conor.t1_d0pdd4y
1
Yea I think the combination of bad matchup AND inability to adapt caused the loss. I don't think this exposes McGregor at all but at the same time I wouldn't say WOW NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE.t1_d0pczpn
2
He just hasn't fought someone with a complete game. We saw him get tagged up by Mendes in a similar way, but mendes couldn't finish it after getting gassed from not having time to prep for the fight. Had mendes been the original opp, that fight would have ended similarly. The Aldo fight still blows my mind, Aldo got rattled and after being on top so long should have known how to deal with it.t1_d0pczpn
2
None of those points really mattered in this fight he hit him at well and got inside plenty of times he just gassed by throwing too many punches t1_d0pdpet
2
I disagree - theres a big difference in gassing because you're tired and "gassing" when you're hurt. McGregor got hurt and rocked. He looked slow and started fading because he took a ton of damage. t1_d0pe2ua
1
He gassed before he got rocked. Or else I would agree.t1_d0pe2ua
2
He wasn't become slow due to damage it was due to him gassing out he was already looking gassed at the end of 1 he threw way too many punches and did not lace himself at all. t1_d0pe9l4

Humble in victory, Humble in defeat. Really? When has Conor ever been humble in Victory? t1_d0pd1c0
1
He does always show props and respect after winning, he's talked about what a great champ aldo was. But he let his head get too big, talking about getting the 170 belt too and standing n banging with a diaz bro. This fight showed what a crazy fucking sport this is, no one is untouchable t1_d0pd1c0
2
When he made that big Instagram post about how Aldo was a great fighter &amp; that he respected him? Similarly for Mendes for taking the fight on short notice.t1_d0pdtxc

Giving respect is not being humble. 

Humble: having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance.

Really? Are we talking about the same person? Where's my coffee? !?!?!?!?t1_d0pdzjx

Barely anyone is humble by that definition in the realm of combat sports. When you knock one of the greatest of all time out in 20 seconds, I think it's pretty fair to estimate your importance very highly.t1_d0pd1c0

In the post fight in the ring he is usually very respectful of his opponents. He gets into full McGregor mode when selling the Fight though and it went completely against him.t1_d0pcpr4

> I was screaming that when he tried to take Nate down

When I watched I was reminded of the GSP versus Matt Sera fight. I saw McGregor was rocked, and I thought, just be defensive, cover up, move back, and get your head to stop spinning. But he went for it.t1_d0pdfgr

Conner feels like 80% skill and 20% mind games. The first round he portrayed that skill and once he cut him I think he thought he was just gonna walk away with it and tried to put on some kinda flashy show. Even when he got rocked it seem like while he was wobbling around like it didn't phase him. Great job by Nate, hope to see Connor back, this should ground him.t3_4965yf
4
As a Diaz fan tonight was glorious t3_4965yf
3
This came down to one thing game plan. Conor tried to fight the same way he fights 145 with a lot of movement and free flowing shots. The issue is he hasn't fought at 170 before and his body was willing to keep that pace. Once round 2 started he was already gassed and then got caught and it was done.  He should have looked to be more efficient but let's not kid ourselves this wasn't and should have been a close fight he did too much and got caught.t1_d0pdoc3
0
Totally agree man.t3_4965yf
2
Silly, silly McGregor. He had an exceptional first round, keeping Diaz at bay, and exploiting all his weaknesses. But then he got rocked in the second, and did exactly what Diaz always wants from his opponents; shoot for the take-down. I believe it was the "Inside The Octagon" breakdown where it was discussed how Diaz is not great at take-downs, and likes to rile up his opponents so they put themselves in a compromising position, thinking that moving to wrestling is the only way forward. Shitty decision by McGregor that Diaz capitalized on expertly. t1_d0pejf8

watch the first round again, Diaz lands a lot. Commentators miss a lot of it too which was annoying.t1_d0pejf8

#HumbleinVictoryandDefeat

Uh, what?t1_d0pdg95
12
Right? The fuck are people agreeing with him for about being humble? Conor to Chad Mendes post fight: "You hit the deck like a bitch! I butchered your face"t1_d0pdj22
1
Please don't tell me people are actually patting him on the back.  I was being sarcastic.  Minus the blood, Diaz was solid all the way through.  My group all noted how slow Conor was in the losing round... something had changed.t1_d0pdj22
5
That was at a later press conference.

In the post fight octogon interview they were both very humble, hugging and calling each other brother.

And before he said that to Mendes, Cerrone said that McGregor was very cordial to him backstage before the conference began, so McGregor really puts up an act, and he only said what he said because Mendes challenged his victory over him.t1_d0pdq2m
2
If you think it's all an act you've seriously gotta be deluded.

Now part of it is that the environment they've putting the fighters in. Obviously the press conference exists to facilitate hype/banter/tension between the fighters. 

However, almost *no one* acts like he does. He is literally anything but humble. He flatus his money, he berates his opponents, he acts like he's a god walking among mortals. 

Their is literally no objective way to quantify him as 'humble' when you compare him to any other athlete.

"Humble in victory of defeat" 

This is literally like the most asinine piece of doublespeak I've ever heard. It's super easy to be humble directly after a win or loss. 

You have nothing to gain by acting like a jackass if you win, and you have nothing to gain by acting like a jackass if you lose. I mean typically when you win something and the press is off your entire state of mind changes to something akin to relief/happiness. You have to try really hard to be a sore winner. 

I don't even care if someone is humble or not. I don't think anyone *needs* to be humble, but don't call someone humble if they're not. Just because he says he's humble doesn't make him humble.

His actions dictate how he is perceived. He doesn't act in a humble manner for a majority of the press/media he does. He typically goes beyond normal trash talk and actually attacks a persons character / personal life instead of just their fighting ability. How is that humble whatsoever?

Do you have a source for this? This would be SO amazing to send to a friend! He was riding the hype train hard, tonight was SO worth it!t1_d0piaet

It was either before the Mendes fight or just after it. Might have been on one of the embedded vlogs for either UFC 189 or UFC 194. Could also have been on that 45min embedded documentary UFC put out before UFC 194 fight with Aldo. I don't remember exactly where it was but after he said it UFC marketing team made a big deal out of it saying McGregor has a do or die mentality everytime he steps inside the octagon. But clearly when someone is choking the life out you and blood to your brain is slowly getting cut off and you are left helpless at their mercy your fighting philosophy is truly tested and clearly McGregor bought into his own hype and doesn't have that mindset.t1_d0pyloa

"Dude, seriously. Diaz isn't a featherweight, he isn't going to get one-punched like the other guys Conor has sniped. And if he gets desperate and goes to the ground, Diaz is one of the best sub artists I've seen."

Hi guys!

I come from a boxing background and I enjoy watching MMA, I just don't follow it as strongly as I do for boxing.

I just have one thing I need clarification on:

I kept wondering why McGregor had his hands down a majority of the fight. I was trying to determine whether or not it was a style or him being cocky. Is that how McGregor always fights? Is that common in MMA?

I also believe I heard McGregor say that he would fight Mayweather. After what I saw tonight, I don't think it would be possible.t1_d0pdc2a
1
In MMA it's beneficial to keep your hands down to defend the take downs. The higher your hands are, the longer it takes to get them down for underhooks when your opponent shoots in. That said, he is also a cocky fighter. t1_d0pdc2a

I still think that Conor has a decent chance at being lightweight champ. Dos Anjos is a motherfucker though.t1_d0pe900
1
Dunno, this fight showed that he can quickly run out of options if his lefty isnt putting his opponent out. You put a guy like rda who wont stand in front of you, and will move around, kick your leg, take you down, gnp... he will need to increase his gas tank about 4 times just to handle the pace that rda can bring.

There is always the chance of him landing a nice first round shot and winning, but lets be honest, every minute that passes by his chances will be decreasing together with his punching power.t1_d0pehov
1
I agree. But RDA tends to come out with his chin up. There's a big chance Conor can stay alive long enough to land something. If he does, it's over. If he doesn't, he's screwedt3_4965yf

Yeah - that was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  What good things did he think could possibly happen for him on the ground?

I mean even when Conor had Nate on his back in the first, Nate's guard was so solid that he couldn't touch himt3_4965yf
2
I liked what Conor said at the end but he was already starting to rewrite the story. Nate straight up boxed him into a daze then subbed him when he dove to evade.t3_4965yf
2
I think Conor also gassed prior to getting tagged. He went from mixing it up with kicks and punches to standing and trading which in my opinion made him more predictable and If he didn't knock Diaz out, obviously it was only a matter of time before Diaz ran Conors tank dry and rang his bell. I didn't expect Conor to slow so soon.t1_d0pdt5g

I jumped on the Conor bandwagon after the Mendez win. I'm bummed about his loss, but One thing that came apparent to me is how much Conor cares about his fans. He agreed to fight at 170. And stayed behind for the interview after the devastating defeat.t1_d0pd7yy

Thoughts on tonight:

Conor couldn't just stay in his lane. He got drunk off of the power of visualizations, positive mindset, winning philosophy, etc. and got too cocky. He was surrounded by Yes Men in his camp including enabler Ido Portal. His main focus became the money, something which he had never experienced in abundance before, and he became drunk off of the promotion of the events. He made decisions based on what sounded the best on paper, not what reality was or what was correct. Had Conor have been more patient, stayed in his own lane, he could have done everything he imagined in due time. As is usually the curse when raw talent and gifted ability are paired with youth, Conor became impatient and careless. He will learn a lesson from this and become a stronger and better person.t1_d0pe34i
1
I think he beats rda now or frankie.  They are must wins for him. t3_4965yf
2
I thought conor was going to totally dismantle Diaz. I was so fucking wrong. It looked like he was in the early parts of the fight but as soon as it became a slug fest Diaz really used his reach to turn conor into a  wrestler. Good shit Diaz you the real mother fucking gangsta t1_d0pe476

Nate Diaz finally got paid. Yessss. 

But Conor did not lose anything. He still has his belt,  got paid $10mill, and learned a valuable lesson about holes in his game. 

t1_d0pea1t
2
Yeah, I realize that - but I'm just thinking that with only a little over a minute left in the round, backing off the punches for a second to catch your breath when you're a striker seems like a much better idea than trying to go to the ground with a black belt.t1_d0pe4ok
3
He lost his so called invincibility and his trash talk will be altered somewhat cause they can always throw this back at him. He can bounce back though. t1_d0pe71c
1
The fact he tapped out like a lil bitch when holm just choked out like a real fighter. I counted at least a half a dozen Stockton bitch slaps as well and it was glorious. t1_d0pe71c

I think you're buying into his hype more than him. t1_d0pee1u

thats what i was saying. he was show boating and trying to show off " cmon, hit me atleast ", so nate did. after Nate rocked him he put his hands up almost as much as to say " so what now?? " and then picked him apart.

extremely disapointing to see professional fighters disrespect their opponents and the sport itself.t1_d0pejjr
1
Eh I mean it's part of the game, and frankly I think MMA is better for it. Smack talk and head games are all part of it - any combat sport, at least where it is tolerated. t1_d0pem5h
1
Outside of the ring for sure, I think it's great and I love Conor's antics. But inside the ring to do what he did then was just stupid and unprofessional as a mixed martial artist. Anderson Silva tried to pull the same hands down ' hit me ' shit against Weidman the first time and got knocked out. Now Conor probably won't have his covetted title fight with Dos Anjos, Diaz will probably take his place and Conor will probably go back to defending his title at 145 with a rematch against Aldo. All because he had chose to showboat. Very disapointing!t1_d0phnu1
2
Eh. To me it's all a part of the game. Showboating is another tool in the arsenal, to me. How effective it is depends on your skills and when and how you showboat. It's another nuance of the game. Agree to disagree, I guesst1_d0pi2u5
1
Yeah I guess it is. And that's apart of what makes  Conor's persona soo great too. But its just disapointing to see him throw away a fight like that that I think he easily could have won if he hadve stayed focused and not toyed around. But then again look at what happened to Holly! She fraught soo well and got caught with one slip up in the last few minutes and that was that! Who's to say Diaz wouldn't have found another opening? But yeah, it's all apart of the game.t1_d0pijc7
2
The main problem was that Conor was throwing a lot of power shots and got tired. He was keeping his hands down a lot too, but I think ultimately him getting so winded like that is what did him in.
t1_d0pj4ni
1
That is also very true. Conor said many times after the fight that he thought he was inefficient with his energy compared to Nate, and that he shoukd have been picking his shots more then just throwing everything into wild strikes.t1_d0pdun1

It wasn't stupid, I mean he was getting hurt and outclassed on the feet. To keep fighting on the feet would have clearly lead to a KO.

Hey it's you again!

> Yeah the entire fight I was saying he looked slow and sloppy, like he wasn't ready for the weight class.

Yeah? I'm not gonna lie man, that first round it looked like McGregor was winning pretty strongly. Pretty early into the fight I was like "wow, ok. So McGregor's gonna win, just a matter of time" and in my defense, even Diaz said he was off to a slow start.

Nick gets cut a lot too on his eyebrow ridge. I heard he got some of his bone shaven down to try to improve that. Speaking of Nick, any idea when he's coming back??

Another question. Who would you want to see McGregor fight next? RDA or Frankie Edgar, or someone else? I'm feelin Edgar. After this I think RDA would run through McGregort3_4965yf

I wanna see Edgar no doubt. The talk is making that an interesting option, but I see McGregor beating him in under 3 rounds. 

And yeah, I didn't really follow Nate Diaz despite following Nick pretty often. Nick's trash talk fits my style a little more so I didn't even bother, unfortunately. That first round was easily McGregor's but watching his punches you could see a MAJOR difference in his speed and accuracy. He missed a lot of punches and wasn't recoiling nearly as quickly as he does at 145t1_d0pcoui

He'll never be the GOAT because he's just not that good.t1_d0pde44

I agree that he's not THAT good, but he can get better. I think GSP is the greatest ever, and he got better with every fight, rather then starting off with unbelievable skills like Jon Jones (Although Georges was pretty good right off the bat too). Considering his work ethic, i don't think it's impossible that Conor bounces back and starts making a claim for greatest ever. He's got a long road ahead though.t1_d0pdy5m

Huh. I wasn't picking up on that, gotta rewatch it. He was missing for sure, but he was looking pretty accurate in that first round overall as I remember it.

Duuude I just remember Cruz and Faber 3 is happening. That's gonna be sick too. Kind of like this fight, I love Cruz but kind of want to see Faber win. Cruz is kind of douchey and it'd be nice to see Faber get some belt-action for once. Cruz is in my top 3 favorites fighters tho.t3_4965yf

McGregor is like Jones for me. I honestly don't think he's that good, he's just good. But he compensates it a lot with reach and height vs smaller opponents, and that's when he seems to be more than he actually is. Now he fought someone his "on size", even a little taller and larger reach. 

A good example of what I'm saying was Jones vs Gustafsson. 

Let's see how Aldo will deal with Diaz, and if the one-punch-knockout after rushing like a retarded on McGregor was just a silly mistake or he really isn't that big of a deal anymore.t1_d0pdfjy

Let's be fair here. I'm not an avid Conor fan(You can check my reddit history, i've been trying to piss off his obnoxious fanbase for months now). However, you have to admit the guy is a ridiculous striker. The same goes for Jon Jones, however his wrestling is also elite, his Bjj is ridiculous and his mental toughness is unreal(See Vitor Belford fight for proof there). Conor doesn't have good ground game and it's super well known, his wrestling is also kinda mediocre. The two aren't really that similar. t1_d0pdt4g
0
Maybe that's just my opinion then... I really don't see a ridiculous striker. Just a good one, and with a style that makes him look even better when he wins. 

I also didn't meant him and Jones were similar. Just similar things happened to both of them, and it showed they aren't really THAT good. t3_4965yf
4
Conor had a nice first round -- put together a few nice combos, was staying away from Nate's jab and had Nate cut. But that grew into overconfidence and although Nate was bleeding he was never really hurt (I'm pretty sure Rogan said the Diaz brothers have a ton of scar tissue and they bleed easily)

I think Conor's overconfidence led to him trying to prove that he had some sort of iron chin in the second round but for Christ sake's man it doesn't matter who you are after you take 3-4 clean shots right on the chin you need to start putting your hands up. His head stopped moving, Nate connected, and the rest was a mixture of being rocked, getting panicked, and getting absolutely outclassed on the ground by a BJJ black belt.

Hats off to Nate that was an awesome fight. Short notice or not he proved Conor has no chance against the big boys. I hope Conor still gets to fight dos Anjos though. I think 155 is his true weight class.t1_d0pdig1
0
Nate fights at 155 and Dos Anjos fucked him up.t1_d0pdig1
2
I agree - he needs to stay the hell away from welterweight. All his fans that were saying he was going to take that belt were delusional... weight classes exist for a reason. He needs to cut back down to 145 or go to 155 - where he can fight Diaz again or something. He bit off way more than he could chewt1_d0pdig1
5
He wasn't trying to prove he had a iron chin, He was showing classic signs of fatigue, when fighters get fatigued usually first sign is the hands dropping and lack of head movement and this is exactly what we seen. t1_d0pd7yy
16
He was dead on his feet. He knew he was going to get dropped if he kept trading. It was his only chance at regaining his faculties.

When Conor was in Nate's guard in the first, there was a moment where he left his arm out & Nate saw it. Conor didn't seem to notice. I was sure it was gonna end in a Nate sub right there.t1_d0pdr0f
-1
I think he was fatigued too, but there were definitely a few times where he would talk shit/say something after taking a shot. As if to say that they weren't hurtingt1_d0pdtoz
3
That's standard in fighting in my experience, Just a defense mechanism to try and convince the guy not to jump on you or show him you're still there, I would guess. It's just a subconscious reaction for some people when they get hurt, Can't count how many times this happens in fights especially boxing. Nothing unique to Conor.t3_4965yf
4
Conor fan here... Also a bjj brown belt who lives in the USA and is from Scotland/Ireland. Conor has some of the best stand up in the game, but his ground game is abysmal. I understand this problem, we have no wrestling or bjj pedigree. We are raised on boxing and boxing alone. 

It was great to see conor take this defeat with dignity, I sincerely hope that he takes the loss as a lesson learned. He was submitted by a world class gracie black belt. As a millionaire champ, He needs to take the next 6 months to a year and find the best BJJ school he can, train 9 hours a day and drill hard like a mother fucker.

Lord knows every single one of his opponents watched this and now has the game plan of taking him to the ground. We all knew this was his weakness.

Ditch the Ido Portal bullshit. Hire a high level bjj black belt and Train like a motherfucker. If w as a millionaire champ, that's what i would do. C'mon conor. Learn from your mistakes.

IMO he was probably too dazed to think clearly for his BJJ game. That takedown was a last ditch effort.t1_d0pdoiv

he lost because he got punched in the face.  He tried to take it to the ground as desperation. The fight was already over.t1_d0pdoiv

Maybe train under the Diaz brothers. I heard they're pretty good t1_d0pdoiv

You do understand it was conor who tried to take diaz down because he couldn't hang on the feet right?

If Conor stayed striking with Diaz he was getting KO'd.
t1_d0pdoiv

He has heavy hands but terrible defense. He got lit up and the only reason he was submitted and not knocked out is because he tried to make the punches to the face stop by going for a takedown .t1_d0pdoiv

Got beat, stayed in the ring for an interview when most leave. Came to the post fight presser and admits he panicked when Diaz took his shots. So many super stars in the UFC run off and his after losing. Respect to Conor. t1_d0pf8ax

jesus christ get off his nuts.  So many ufc super stars run off after losing?  Vitor has never run off, dan henderson has never run off, chuck liddel, gsp, matt hughes, rich franklin all stayed to do interviews.  Conor wasnt exactly humble as he kept making excuses saying nate was more efficient with his energy.  AKA, Nate beat my ass and I have no excuse because I gassed so I'm going to say he was more efficient with his energy. t1_d0pfzxy

Not on his nuts. He admitted he panicked. I like Conor for his fighting style on his feet, could do without a lot of the BS. I wasn't referring to older fighters I was referring to the current generation. t1_d0pg4kr

Conor has a powerful left shot. Thats it. Guy was gifted the mendes fight that shot him to Aldo. I'll give him the Aldo win because a punch is a punch and Aldo crumbled. Conor's kicks were ineffective because he can't kick worth shit. Reciting what Nate already said, Conor trains with nobodies and beat midgets.

I'm a fan and I see both sides. Diaz deserved his victory, but Conor just like the good entertainers in the UFC before him talk  and back it up until that can't. If me being a loyal fan to a fighter I like is being on his nuts, better than the bandwagon fans who are all of the sudden 209 fans. t1_d0pg5rr
2
i dont like either guy. But Conor talked a lot of shit to a guy taking a fight on 11 days notice. the kind of shit talk you can't do especially when you are gifted figthts the way conor has been. calling nate and his team mates a bunch of bums? Any of those guys would handle Conor. especially Jake Shields who took a direct shot of Hendo's H-Bomb and didn't go out.

Conor goes beyond talking and just trash talks out his ass, disrespectful as fuck.  Nate talks a lot of shit and 50% of the time it makes no sense why hes angry towards lets say, RDA or Josh Thompson who beat his ass. t1_d0pf8ax

They were the same weight.  Conor had a big size advantage in all his previous fights, which is the main reason why he was so successful at 145t1_d0pfb1k

Two weeks notice, I am not discrediting Diaz at all. I know most real mma fans know Conor has a weak ground game and would most likely get tapped from a choke seeing as that's Diaz go to and it's how Conor had lost his only 2 fights. Conor doesn't walk around at 170 at most he is walking around at 160-165. Time stamp of him saying he cut is at 32:50.t1_d0pfrhl

1
I would say it was more of Conor getting into his own head. The frustation of Diaz being the one who truly does not give a fuck made Conor nervous. You can clearly see that when he threw a sucker punch at the presser and flinched at the weigh ins. He was on edge the entire time.t3_4965yf

Conor couldn't get into his head. Diaz just doesn't give a fuck. Can't lose the pre-game mental warfare.

Conor and a lot of others need to understand that there was no weight advantage here . Rogan said it in the beginning about how interesting this fight will be when both fighters didn't have to cut weight.

Doesn't change much for him I don't think. He is still the champ at 145. Conor was eating two breakfasts a day to get to 170 and still came in under. Diaz showed even the best stand up guys can't do shit without a ground games. Both dudes took bombs. Best fight I've seen in awhile! t1_d0pd30n

Damn, I thought I was the first to make that comment.t3_4965yf

I just rewatched the fight with no sound, in slow motion, and noticed some VERY interesting things that run contradictory to what I thought I saw on first viewing. I started slow motion just before the punch that rocked McGregor. Prior to this moment, it was pretty clear McGregor was winning the fight. Not only the first round, but the beginning of the second as well. 

What was really surprising was just how few of Nate's shots actually landed, after the shot that rocked Conor ("The One"). Watching them in normal speed, with all the commentary, it looked like everything Nate threw after The One connected. However, if you watch in slow motion with no sound, you can see that most of these shots (I would guess something like more than 95% just by rough estimate) are either all dodged by McGregor, missed by Nate, or are glancing shots. I was very surprised because I thought Nate was connecting on everything he threw on my first viewing. 

The only real shots Nate landed after The One, were after Conor shot, and Nate was in top position. He landed two VERY hard shots on Conor's chin. Those probably did the most damage after The One. 

Other things that surprised me: there are so many more Stockton slaps in this fight than one could imagine. You think it's like 3-5, but it's really 10+. Even Conor throws one or two in there, one of them being a stockton fake with the right, and followed up with a left. 

I also thought Conor's movement was poor in the first on first viewing, but on second viewing it didn't look like that. It just looked like Conor kept going for a KO. 

Biggest shots landed looked to be by McGregor, but Nate just ate them up. It's insane. That guy has an iron chin. Nate's biggest shot was definitely the one that wobbled McG on his legs. And ever since that one, it was all downhill (but not with as many connections as you would think. Conor's head movement after that shot was excellent in slow motion). t1_d0pdl02

Diaz landed 60 percent (54 of 90) of his strikes in the second round after landing just 37 percent (23 of 62) in the first round.

What I noticed about diaz in almost all his fights: his first round is a lot of trying different things, basically figuring out his opponent. He gets tagged a lot but relies on his chin and skills to avoid anything fight ending. 

 Diaz was bleeding but he is almost always bleeding somewhere because he cuts so easy due excessive scar tissue. during the first Diaz was figuring out Conors range, typical combos and timing he was getting cracked a few times with the left. If you watch closely (which was what I was doing) as the fight wore on diaz was getting hit less and less. close doesnt mean anything, infact too many close calls shows me that diaz had the range figured out.

the biggest problems for conor was 1) Mcgregors style is very much a counter punchers game, similar to Silva he provoked an engagement then  would use his reach advantage and natural power to hit people before they could reach him. this was not there when he fought Diaz and suddenly he had to be the aggressor and that could not be maintained for a long time. 2) he was used to being stronger and that was no longer the case 

I think diaz did lose the first round but was winning the second round or too close to be really anything even before catching McGregor. The first round was fairly close too but Conor had the heavier punches so would have given it to him but he seemed to be scrambling and pushing forward a lot to catch diaz and wasnt as natural of a flow. 

also people really underestimate diaz punching. As he said after the fight, people suddenly become wrestlers when they get into trouble on their feet so he has a lot of submission wins. he doesnt give a fuck if its a KO on the feet. Nate and Nick also have this wacky high volume low energy jab that doesnt do much so their opponents get this false sense of security and can walk through it or trade but occasionally they both really try to put power behind one and catch people. 

in the end something seems to have clicked in Nate's game and has twice now made great fighters look silly.

note I have said all this before the fight when people were dismissing nate not as a fan of nate but as a MMA fan who thought the match up was legit.t3_4965yf

I mean, Conor was BANGING Nate up. Got a little too confident, dropped his hands, threw some show-off kicks, got tired, and Diaz started tagging him with the same 1-2 that he nailed Johnson with so many times. It wasn't a dominant victory from Nate by any stretch, I'd love to see this fight again at 155 with full camps. I love the Diaz bros, and I love Conor, and Conor was outboxing Nate, who is one of the best. Diaz got beat up but proved once again that he is raw and downright impossible to put away. It was a fun bout, and as fans we are losing big time if we never see a 155 rematch.t1_d0pgqgo

Not really banging him up. Its a routine Diaz fight, set the pace and wait until they crumble. 

It always looks much worse because the Diaz bros got enough scar tissue to feed africa.

Eh, watch the fight again. Conor was landing at will. Again, he threw some flashy kicks, tired himself out, and Nate started getting the best of him, before that, it was Conor landing shot after shot. I know the Diaz bros cut easy, but Nate was getting out boxed, plain and simple, his chin is insane, MOST guys would've gone down after taking a beating like that. t3_4965yf

Conor learned why weight classes exist. Nate walks around  180-185, conor bulking up with no cut weighed 168. Props to both of them, Diaz for fighting short notice and conor fighting 15 lbs higher than he planned too. Those shots Conor was landing would have sent anyone at 145 to the mat, but that power simply doesn't translate to guys who walk around at 180+.

Yup. 

And some shit he says I wouldn't even consider an insult. 

Like you said, seems like he tries too hard and tries to pack in as much shit as possible in as little time as possible. Just seems so forced.. But I guess it appeals to the masses, and especially those that only look at highlights of conferences; not the entire thing. t1_d0pe4yd

Conor walks around at 170 so it isn't really a huge jump.t1_d0pe696

That's like saying nate walks around 185 lbs so fighting a MW isn't a huge jump. Yea it is.t1_d0pjak5
1
Nate also fights 155 while Conor fights at 145 so there's still only 1 weight class differential. I'd usually agree with you but Conor cuts down to 145 from 170, then gains maybe 10-15 pounds the next day before fighting in the featherweight division(Compare the Conor at weign-ins in both Chad Mendes and Jose Aldo to the day of the fight pictures) so it's not as if his opponents didn't face the same kind of difference every fight. This is just the first time where he hasn't been the bigger fighter in the ring. t1_d0pe4yd

2 minutes before the choke it was obvious it was over. Connor was so dazed after that chin shot when Diaz said whats up. I can't believe how good the odds were to bet on Diaz.... Lots of money was made. I got 800:1 on Diaz to win by submission rd2. Too bad i only put $10 on that.... Put some losing bets too so only made a few k. The fight was only going to go 2 ways: conor by KO early or Diaz by submission in 2nd or 3rd. It was so clear. Great fight. Have you ever stacked on 25 pounds? No way conor competed past the 1st. He knew that. He was so gassed after the first. Done. Diaz will beat him any day of the week at that weight. Yeah Diaz got some punishment but he has the iron jaw we have all seen. Dude can throw and he can take. t3_4965yf
2
I thought that was an amazing fight and they both did very well. I think Conor might have beaten RDA but Nate's lack of holes in his standup and his defensive boxing were always going to present a challenge for Conor and he obviously more dangerous on the ground.

Great show. I'd love to see the fans appreciate both fighters. Make your snidey comments and act all smug for a few days but lets be real. Neither were embarrassed and they both looked great.t3_4965yf

Coming out of round one I thought there was no way Diaz could make it out of round two. He was taking bomb after bomb and just went nuts on Conor for the entire second round. Amazing, gutsy performance, and the defeat has so far been accepted with grace by Conor. I think both men looked like worthy champions in their own wayst3_4965yf

Congrats to Nate he really knows how to warm up, so dissapointed in Conor. All he had to do is hold his hands up and not be so fucking cocky and take advantage of Nate's eye and he might have won that fight, but even with that avantage Conor didn't seem to have that much energy be able to make it to 5th round at 170.

Very cool to see Diaz get his moment in the spotlight.

 You could see that McGregor was getting exhausted even after the first round, Exactly like he said he fought inefficiently, maybe partly from the jump in weight but his work rate was too high. He was really fucking Diaz up, Then he hit a wall and got caught, from there he was spent and it was over. 

I don't agree with Rogan saying his jiu jitsu got exposed though, He was hurt and exhausted which is why he had no defense. t1_d0pdanc

No it most definitely got exposed, you could've had full tank of gas McGregor and Diaz would still have choked him out. 

I'm not saying it's a particularly bad thing, if he can continue winning fights on the feet it's great and entertaining to watch, but if he wants to step up in weight and fight some legit killers he's gonna need to round out certain aspects of his game and not drop his hands vs people who are naturally bigger guys..

awww look at all the conor bandwagoners downvoting you...t3_4965yf
2
1) Conor should be at 155.  Meaning he realistically went up a single weight class 2) Chad Mendez would have beat his ass, even as a smaller opponent, if he had adequate time to prepare 3) Conor has established himself as a one trick pony.  Amazing striking, but Khabib or Askren would rag doll him. 4) What's the difference between holly and Conor's demise?  Conor taps as soon as he's in a choke hold.  Holly.. doesn't tap at all.  

This mcgregor hype is exactly that.t1_d0pxcem
-2
Give it up man. His last fight before Diaz was 145 so it is fact he went up 2 weight classes to fight. He ate some of Chads hardest punches. A full camp Chad might take him further than 2 but the end result would still be the same. His ground game is ass but his striking and movement is better than most that he will come up against so they cancel each other out to an extent. The difference is both fighters had no chance of getting out that choke hold. Tapping and doing some shadow boxing shit before you choke out doesn't mean shit they both still lost. The Mcgregor hype train was more than justified and it will no doubt continue. t1_d0pz59w
1
So what?  he cuts a shit load of weight and it's universally accepted he should be at 155 which is where nate is at on a non 10 day notice.  You might be right about Chad.  That is opinion based on how inept conor is on the ground.  We're on the same page about conors skillset.  

The hype train is justified in terms of conors insanely good striking.  But there's a lot more to MMA than that as we just saw.

Edit: and the hype train just got demoted by 50% at minimum.

There's a video of cuss d'amato talking about the real way to do damage, which he says is light and fast volume. Paraphrasing but he says that a man can take a big shot but not 6 small shots.

keeping your hands up has never been in boxing textbooks. that shit didnt start until the gloves got bigger and tyson popularized the peekaboo style that cus damato taught. boxing defense has always left your hands free to counter. you couldnt rely on sticking your hands up and hoping for the best with the smaller gloves. defense was based on positioning, footwork and deflections with the shoulders. conor used classic boxing techniques. he didnt lose because he kept his hands down. he lost because he gassed out and shot on a bjj back belt. t1_d0pcxmg

There's a difference between not having your hands up in front of your face and letting them hang loose at your side, which is what he did numerous times throughout the fight.  He was trying to taunt him and finally got tagged doing it in the second.  He then did it right after to try and show that he could take his best shot, at which point he got his bell rung and was unbalanced for the remainder.

He was using boxing techniques at the start and had the fight in the bag until he got cocky and lowered his guard, which is what lost him the fight.t3_4965yf

I feel like we all knew going in Connor isn't good on the ground. The desperation shoot to buy time was a fatal error, but one that needed to be made.

The funny thing I saw was people shitting on Connor for tapping when Holly didn't tap. That's a mistake on Holly's part. You should always tap. It's fucking stupid not to tap, that's how people end up in the hospital. Know your limits, it's rule #1.t1_d0pd04z

Everything from the takedown attempt, to the escape to giving up his back were beginner mistakes. That's where he went wrongt1_d0pe1u4
2
You see the hand on his head? The correct way to escape is to grab that and pull it. When it is on top of your head and not behind your head with the palm faced away, you can grab it. He had no clue what to do and just wanted out at that moment.t3_4965yf

That was an awesome fight. Conor has ZERO ground game. Both dude at bombs that would put the normal man to sleep. 

Questions though, does this change anything for either guy going into their next fights? Conor still has the belt at 145 and could fight at 155 for the title. Does Diaz get a shot at the 170lb title? He got dismantled at his last 155 title fight. This will be interesting to see how it plays out. t3_4965yf

Dana's live reaction video please.t1_d0pd6kg
17
I wouldn't call that karate. He was slipping punches like a boxer and he drops his hands to get in people's heads like Anderson Silva. It's just a mind game / disrespect thing. I think his downfall was he started to not respect nates game as he was starting to connect and started bloodying up nates face. He started worrying less about defense, started moving his head less, and started focusing more on how good he was doing. The problem is the Diaz brothers have granite chins and have won so many fights in that exact fashion. You start beating them up and drop your defense in an attempt to finish the fight, and then they catch you and you're fucked. t3_4965yf

Also, let the record show that Conor and Nate were almost exactly the same weight walking into the octagon. They did not cut weight for weigh ins. I see a lot of people excusing Conor for biting off more than he could chew in a heavier weight class against a bigger guy. Longer and taller, yes, but Nate had no size advantage in terms of weight. What we saw was Conor fighting someone his own size for once. t3_4965yf

I'm not a Conor fan and was ecstatic to see him humbled, but you have to give the man props for always taking whatever fights are thrown at him. Changing from Jose to Mendes and RDA to Nate on short notice. He was humble in defeat and I'll always look forward to his fights.

I dont care how rocked Conor was, shooting should have been the LAST thing that ever crossed his mind in any conceivable situation in that fight. Would have stood a punchers chance at the very least if he would have stayed up a bit longer and risked getting put to sleep. Hindsight is always 20/20 and i wasnt the one who just got smashed across the jaw but...still. I cant understand where anywhere in his mind would have told him that was a good idea.t1_d0pdgjf

I really want to hear from McGregor what his thought process was when he devices to shoot. I know "panicked fighters become wrestlers" but McGregor send smarter than that. Like did he think the fight was going to slow down? Did he think Nate's ego was so big he wouldn't take advantage of being on the ground? Taking wonderboy to the ground is a viable strategy. Taking Nate to the ground? It just doesn't make sense. t3_4965yf

He hadn't heard the 10 seconds tap yet (because it was still a minute off) and was about to get KOd, I think he figured he had a better chance to survive on the ground to the end of the round and then try to collect himself before the third.

It wasn't necessarily the wrong move either, Diaz was about to knock him the fuck out. It was a big time gamble, but he was 99.9% done at that point anyway.t3_4965yf

That's absolutely true, but I'm not sure. Keeping his guard up will limit his countering opportunities. It's a tough thing to balance.

Aldo should learn a thing or two from Nate. I'm not always a fan of all the stuff the Diaz brothers say, but I am entertained most of the time AND you can't doubt their toughness in the octagon.

Nate took the fight. Aldo may have been injured and not cleared or whatever, but he REALLY shouldn't be talking now.t1_d0pdusj

Does anyone have the lead up to this?  From the combo to takedown. My stre.. err.. PPV cut out exactly before this moment and when I got it back Joe was doing a recap. t3_4965yf
1
The one thing that sucks is that there is the factor of 170. I don't care that he lost, I just want to see how he would've done vs RDA or even Nate at 155. Kind of stupid that he took the fight at 170 and ate so much that he gassed. t1_d0pdx2m
1
He wouldve been 168 when he entered the cage either way. What do you mean?t1_d0pecut
1
McGregor? No he wouldn't have. He still has to cut to make weight and he would've ate a lot less food. t1_d0pcob7
572
As soon as Diaz saw the buckle, the blood was in the water. Conor was done. Diaz might not have the same resume, but he has been in a lot of fights and knew exactly when the moment to ramp it up was. After the Mendez fight I was wondering how McGregor would do bouncing back when he takes big blows, and you are going to get that moving up weight classes. The guys are bigger, the hits are harder, and when you take a stunning blow it will take longer to recover. 145 to 170 is a huge jump and going against a great boxer just shows how much harder those blows are.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time though. Great fight, and crazy result. McGregor will learn a lot from it, and it will certainly be interesting to see where he goes from here. But you have to give credit to Diaz; took a lot of hard shots, opened his eye up completely, maintained poise and kept his head, and executed like a champ when he saw the window. Amazing.t1_d0pdx2m

I said in a thread coming up to the fight with RDA, that Conor was talking too much trash and not showing respect for other fighters and the sport itself, and that he WAS going down with a 100% probability, sooner or later. Because every single one of them goes down, at one point or another. 

And this is where being respectful for your sport and your opponents comes into play.

Conor will have to deal with a lot of shit talk now. It was coming anyway, and it was crazy of him to not expect an outcome like this. 

May he find solace in his millions of dollars. t3_4965yf

I think biggest thing in this fight was Nates chin. Conor busted his gas tank on that. When he had no more energy to slip he was lit up with Nates boxing. It was over when he got wobbled the first time. Against pretty much any one else below 170 those shots would have been enough. In a perfect world Conor would have utilized leg kicks more early in the fight and taken the safe route ala RDA and folks. t1_d0pe6ie

Damn two fights I was wrong on. I wanted Holy Holm to win and I was certian she would win. On the other hand I wanted Diaz to win but I was sure Conor would be victorious. This was an amazing card to watch and witness,  I haven't been this excited watching UFC in a long time. I'm sure this will be full of Conoor shitposts but this isn't one of them. I have great respect for Conor; he trained for a fight against DOS Anjos but took a short notice fight against Nate. I have even more respect for Nate on taking the short notice fight. This was truly an amazing UFC card and I'm happy I got to see it live.

WHat the fuck are you talking about, Diaz has a way better resume than mcgregor. t3_4965yf

What are peoples thoughts on Conor just not being strong enough? Early on he was landing a lot of punches and I was getting worried for Nate but it was like none of them phased him, none of them had enough power behind them to actually do anything. Does the weight difference actually matter that much? Because you could just look at Nate and see that he was not that fight ready despite him training for a triathlon, he wasn't firm at all and had little muscle definition. But even with that Conors punches didn't do a whole lot and Nate basically wore him down fairly quickly. It was almost weird how fast Conor wore down after getting the two times in the 2nd. He was so quick and agile and then it was like he was moving at half speed.t1_d0pkqye
1
1) the diaz brothers have insane cardio. people who say they have good cardio even top level fighters they are a notch above.

2) they both have this high volume range finding and baiting punching style that has a hidden little point....

3) when diaz bros are doing all those light  jabs that have low power behind them are annoying and opponent's start to feel they can walk through them or ignore them for a chance to land one. then 1 out of 10 (totally made up number) get some power behind them and if this is the one that catches you its like wtf. 

4) nate is an amazing counter puncher and defender against strikes. t1_d0pkqye

I wouldn't call it a great win.  It was a decisive win, yes, but it came in a way that still has a lot of people wondering.   It's like if you're really good at a video game and then you give the controller to your little brother and he one-shots you.  Does that mean he's better at the game than you are?

That's all true, but Conor has some huge physical advantages that imo would have carried him in that fight. And those lefts he threw today at Nate would have knocked Aldo out.

We just don't know. All we do know is that Aldo, one of the greatest fighters ever, got iced by Conor McGregor. t3_4965yf

Yep, that's how the Diaz boys do it. It's funny because I called this for Nate, but I started to doubt myself in that first round, but it's really a textbook Diaz fight. Another fighter just gassing at the volume of punches landing. No major KO power, just punches in bunches.t3_4965yf

He got TKOd by a fucking gnarly headkick that would have probably knocked unconscious almost every LW ever. He was rocked as fuck but still carried on trying to fight. Didn't work out. Corner threw in the towel at the same time as the ref stopped it. Was insane to watch Diaz try and fight through what was most likely a major concussion though.t3_4965yf

Gotta admit I was wrong on this one. 

Started out about how I expected, but I didn't think Conor would fall off the rails so suddenly.  Im still not sure if he was heavily rocked, heavily gassed or both, but either way, Nate turned those tides.  

I suppose its not that surprising though.  Conor was throwing huge power the whole fight, and with frequency.  Not sure he expected Nate to be able to eat it.  A little offtopic, thought wed see a few more kicks.  Seemed like a huge advantage for Conor in the fight.t1_d0pek2p
1
I felt he wouldn't throw kicks because higher chance to get taken down. Especially because he'd have to throw them so high.

I don't know honestly. There's a stark difference between first and second round. He gassed very quickly and was getting tagged. Missing.

He looked slower too. t1_d0pelxo
1
Doesn't have to be to the head.  A thin torso'd opponent and body kicks can really wear them down.  

As for the takedowns, it can increase risk of it, but the Diaz brothers have next to no offensive wrestling.  If I was Conor that would have been the least of my fears.  Especially when you are talking about your biggest tool to negate the range advantage of Diaz.t1_d0pdjmk

Actually, McGregor was trying to gain weight to even make the 170 limit. Eating whatever the fuck he wanted. Messed up his cardio. t3_4965yf

At least Holly went out instead of tap out. t1_d0pfq4g
1
Different circumstances. Tates choke was fightable until it wasn't plus I'm pretty sure Holms air punches at the end were a last moment of conscience effort to tap. Nates choke on the other hand was sunk in from the start, nothing to do but tap or wait 2-3 seconds until you go black. People tap in this moment. You would tap in this moment.t3_4965yf

Apparently Diaz was around 190 when he got the fight so it's probably more of a guy preparing for lightweight bout at his normal walk around weight vs a smaller welterweight. It definitely helped Diaz have more power with the extra weight in comparison to him at lightweight. t3_4965yf

Conor just got a reality check. He's a great FW and maybe who knows a good LW but you can't just jump from 145 to 170. As a Conor fan I hope he goes back to FW and fight Aldo then maybe go up and fight but not against guys like Dos Anjos or Diaz t1_d0pd09m
2
Nate is a LW, they both just decided not to cut weight and do a catchweight at 170. Conner will prob have to go to 145, but it is going to be really hard to stay at that weight. I feel like he falls to the middle of the pack at lightweight.t3_4965yf

lol people wanted McGregor to lose so bad. Everyone who knows MMA knew this was a huge risk for him. I knew his power punches wouldn't affect someone of that size. He's an idiot for standing with his hands down and exchanging with someone naturally bigger than him. He had round 1 and started feeling himself too much. I hope he just stays in 155/145 divisions.

Conor kinda got me back into MMA but it definitely is always good for the sport when anyone can lose at any time, because anyone can win at any time as well.  I was watching Diaz' last fight and did not think there was any way he would get that fight with McGregor but he did and didn't back down as always.  That was a great fight and I hope MMA keeps growing. I just wish it went a few rounds longer, although that might just be because I love those long drawn out fights (I really started watching UFC after I stumbled upon Guida vs. Sanchez when switching channels).  t3_4965yf

It's ridiculous. There was a 1 lbs weight difference for the fight, and there was no point where Diaz used that immense weight advantage to impose his will on Conor.

Two thing I noticed: mcgregor is an amateur on the ground and he tapped fucking quickly.  Holly Holm didnt fucking tap, she was spasming. This is the difference of heart. Nate took punch after punch, didnt quit. C-man quits in a heart beat, as soon its not going his way. People talked about Connor fighting Lawler. Lmao. Even RDA should be out of the question now, its ridiculous.t1_d0pdpqz
1
The Holly fight was for the belt. This one wasn't. McGregor was done by the time the choke came. He gassed by going for the ko early and had nothing left. No need to go to sleep if you don't have to.t1_d0pdthq
2
Fair enough. The fight still showed how ridiculous the talk about Conor winning over RDA (not to mention a possible Lawler fight) was.t1_d0pdpat
-2
There was a chance he catches Lawler right when he declines before someone else does. Lawler has been in some 5 round battles. Hes going to take a shit here sooner or later.

BTW in McGregors defense, I'm sure he didn't do much boxing training in preparation for rda, I'd say he shouldn't be completely counted out, Diaz was short on camp but is pretty consistent with boxing and their Jiu-jitsu, him and his brother.t3_4965yf

I said when this fight was announced that Connor had the better skills on paper (striking anyway), but going up TWO weight classes and taking on a legit, tough, veteran WW??

Not really surprised Diaz won this at all.  Diaz should run with this a and get some $ fights. I don't see him being the champ at WW as the division stands now, but he shows once again he ALWAYS comes to fight, be aggressive, and show legit skill.

Connor has some really, really good striking, but if he's not doing 145 anymore, he needs to stick around at 155, and stop messing around at welterweight. t1_d0pdxvc
1
Yes , you guys are right about Nate fighting at LW. I meant he was a veteran fighter who has fought at WW (against legit fighters too), but the way I typed it did make it seem like I was saying he's a career WW.t1_d0peh4d

Dana just lost all of his favored fighters (Ronda Rousey and Conor McGregor). It's also pretty funny that both Conor and Ronda got outboxed after talking about fighting Floyd Mayweather.

I mean I don't know that he got outboxed. He got outgassed, that's for damn sure. And Diaz is a great striker and has been forever but if Conor had more gas I think it would have been a different fight. That being said, you can't knock out the Diaz brothers and they never get tired either so I suppose it could have just been a matter of time. That perfectly placed hook, tho.t1_d0pgfs3

Diaz saved Conor's life tonight. That wasn't an RNC, it was a Heimlich.

How can you be upset? The Diaz Bros are some of the most loveable people in the sport. Conor was on the road to becoming more obnoxious than Mayweather, now he got a piece of humble pie in the form of a stockton slap. This is the best possible outcome.t1_d0pjkq5
1
Conor was the most interesting thing in the UFC. The perfect storm of exciting personality, exciting fighting style, and willing to fight anyone. Do you know how refreshing that is when guys pull out of fights constantly, and fight only twice a year. 

If this would have been for the title, I would be fucking pumped for Diaz. However, all that happens now is we a champion who just lost as champion still holding a title, and a guy with a big victory who probably won't do anything else with his career. If I HAD to see Conor lose, I would prefer it to be in a fight with something on the line, not what essentially was an exhibition fight. t1_d0ptqey

Well, Conor isnt dead you know. He can still beat people in his own weightclass. Just now he knows that the big boys are a little too much for him to handle.t3_4965yf

Fuck anyone who gives Conor shit for this. Who else is going to go up a weight class on 10 days notice? He has bigger balls than any of you guys hating, and I'm not a nut hugger either. I think it's good for his ego that he lost, but you guys are crazy. He even was beating him til he gassed. If the fight was at least at 155 he probably would've won.t1_d0pgq9m

Bear in mind, Nate Diaz is ranked at 155 and was beaten soundly by Dos Anjos, the guy who McGregor was planned to fight tonight. Conor made a frankly unhealthy weight cut to fight at 145. It will be interesting to see what Conor fights at next. t1_d0phhbr

Yeah but dos anjos took out diaz legs and diaz didn't look motivated to fight that night but after taking a year off it seems like he's ready to fight for the belt.t1_d0pdsib

Ah OK. So even though he may have lost a few matches, he is still good, and he is confident. Alright, I could definitely see why people look to him. He has some badass quotes as wellt1_d0pdyyt
1
Yeah. He was the champ of two weight divisions in Ireland before he signed to the UFC, then he ran through the UFC's featherweight division and beat the champ there, Jose Aldo, who was ranking pound for pound #1 in the world, and undefeated for like 10 years. And he beat him in like 30 seconds.

He's a great, exciting fighter. It's just that no one is unbeatable. I feel like it's hard to be undefeated in any combat sport, but MMA specifically because the fight can take place on the feet and on the ground.

OK - Connor lost. However, let's be honest - his movement, punching, even a good bit of clinching was solid. However, his cardio was way out of wack. We would initially expect excuses from his camp, right? But his interview with Rogan says otherwise - he gave Diaz credit, took it like a man (and still champion), but ceonceeded his lose. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not even a big Connor fan, but the fact that he was upfront with the loss says that next time he's going to be (likely) on point. Frankly, he can't afford to not be on point next time. Correct? The only reason it seems like I'm supporting him is because he works hard (but also, who doesn't?), started from the bottom, and had THE CONFIDENECE to move up weight. It's harder than he thought, true. DIAZ IS DEFINITELY A GREAT 'FIGHTER', but I believe (and again, I'm not a Connor fan) Connor is the superior athlete. I expect, given his experience, and his solid training (again, it looks like Diaz trained too, but in his usual weight class) that he will win some big fights in the future. Let's see what happens!t1_d0pg81y
5
His cardio was just fine, just like it always is. You just can't keep the pace the Diaz bros keep. They do triathlons for fun, that's 11-15hours of racing. They have the best cardio in the entire sport by far. Conor is not the superior athlete. Not even close.t3_4965yf

Styles make fights so who knows. Conor had issues with Nate eating up his punches like cupcakes and still having zero fear to trade with him, RDA might have turned out differently for all we know, he doesn't have Nate's chint1_d0pj95p
1
I'm not even sure the rematch goes the same way. Conor was doing his thing until he started getting worried and tried clowning to open up Diaz. Conor just needed to trust is boxing would eventually win out (not that it would, but clowning against Diaz was obviously a big mistake) -- or maybe he knew he didn't have the conditioning to box all 5 rounds. 

I hope they both go on a win streak and meet in a title fight. That shit would by hype. Nate being the only guy to beat him but in an exhibition fight. Now with a belt on the line, how will people react.  t1_d0peqci

i can't help but lose a little admiration for fighters that tap this quickly after the choke fits. UFC is losing its heros.t1_d0pisws

I've seen this comment a bunch of times and I cant help but get triggered. Tapping is the way to go if you got no way out. Getting choked out because of pride is not the way to go.

Especially when it comes to armbars. I DESPISE motherfuckers who don't tap and force an opponent to break some guys arm, like Nog did vs Mir, Miesha vs Ronda or Hardy vs GSP. If you get caught, you tap. t1_d0pisws

While I agree in some situations, when such a high level bjj guy gets you in as deep a Rear Naked as that.. there's not much point in going to sleep, like Holly. And there was no way he was going to last until the bell, and he was already badly rocked and tired. You don't gain much pride back by going out cold in another man's arms..t1_d0pjj7h

I feel like no matter what people say, Connor is a greater figher than Nate. This fight was lost because Connor was fucking around too much with his guard down.

Don't try to take this Victory away from Diaz. Conor got beat, plain and simple. Just like he beat Aldo. This is fighting you win and you lose. Nate was the better fighter tonight. 

> This fight was lost because Connor was fucking around too much with his guard down.

Bullshit. This fight was lost because McGregor got out boxed and out wrestled. He didn't respect Diaz on the feet or his chin. Sure he made Diaz miss some punches, but Diaz made Conor miss quite a few as well. You make it sound like it wasn't so much as a Diaz win, but it was just a Conor loss. Like it wasn't the fact that Diaz went in there landed his jab, a couple nice lefts and then some slick BJJ. No it was all because Conor magically beat himself. Fuck that, he got beat, it doesn't make him a bad fighter. Conor just has holes in his game, real holes and if he learns from this loss and plugs those holes he'll be one of the greatest to ever do this. Hell just look at GSP even he got beat, came back and retired as one of the greatest ever.t1_d0peeh7

People cut the maximum amount of weight that they can in the fight game. Diaz was probably about 185 when they fought each other after fully hydrated. Connor cut nothing and walked in at 168 or so. Nearly 20 lbs is significant. Nate also has the skull of a monkey with that small ass brain of his. Hard as shit to knockout and Conor said himself that he overexhausted himself over throwing punches. Made it more about energy but that is essentially what he said. He never should have taken that fight.

As for this Chad Menedez bullshit.
1. Conor was prepping for Aldo, totally different fighter so he too was at an equal disadvantage.
2. As a fighter you better be ready when your number is called to step up. Both men did and the better man won.

Conor has to work on his ground game and takedown defense and he admits that but he is the best in the featherweight division and will silence all of his critics. He makes no excuses and is humble in defeat. He is a champion.t3_4965yf

I'll say it again, I haven't seen someone turtle into giving up their back like that in a decade. I'm still in a bit of disbelief that McGregor just rolled over on his own to give Diaz the easy shot at the rear-naked choke.t1_d0pgf38
1
You're not giving Diaz his due. t1_d0pgj1v
1
Huh? I'm fully giving Diaz his due. He got McGregor to roll over with simple punching. That's the kind of shit you used to see ages ago where a guy would get mount, throw a punch to one side and get the guy on the bottom to roll  away from contact right into the submission.

Diaz handled him like it was rookie night at the gym.t1_d0pgk7m
2
I misunderstood you. There are a ton of apologists making excuses here tonight.t1_d0pglif
1
I get you. There's the excuse brigade coming out in force. I'm just saying Diaz made it look easy once he got it on the ground. I thought that's how he would have the shot at winning but I didn't expect it to be so simple. 

He didn't even bother with that potential Kimura. He went right into the top position, put his right arm in position and then popped McGregor's head clear with the left hand punch.

As I said, you used to see guys slip right into the submission when the ground game was still a mystery to many. But to see a top guy make so many mistakes on the ground is eye-raising. It's got me jacked like I haven't felt in ages to see a guy get handled like that.t1_d0pgf38

I'm a neutral in the sense that I'm as much of a Diaz fan as a fan of Conor, and I actually think Conors analysis was spot on. He came out blazing in that first round, and he fought at a totally different weight class. More muscle costs more energy. He won the first round (imo, and yes Nate did say he intentionally had a slow start), but it also expended much of his gas tank. On top of that, when Nate started landing more shots in the second round, every shot drained Conor even more.

Not trying to take anything away from AWESME Nate Diaz, but obviously nobody (including Conor) knew what a huge factor this whole energy thingy would be.

I disagree with nate's statement of being the superior boxer. He was clearly the better wrestler, but conor also clearly dealt more damage. It was almost as if conor was simply trying to deal damage and punish him but not effective in a TKO attempt. Conor kept landing one two's and not following up, then Nate went into desperation mode and luckily caught him and capitalized on conor's lack of grappling defense. What was your take? t3_4965yf

After rewatching this Conor clearly game in way too heavy and that is why he lost. In the first round nothing Nate was throwing landed, he was clearly faster and moving out of the way. After throwing 3 spinning kicks and grappling on the fence, Conor got gassed and then he got rocked. 

I am a McGregor fan but not really sad about this loss. Even Michael Jordan had bad games. I think Diaz benefited more from the short schedule than McGregor. Diaz style is a great match up for him and the fight ended up pretty much exactly how I thought, even the submission.t1_d0pgb7z

Dude wtf are you talking about, Nate is slightly taller and much skinnier, McGregor is slightly shorter and much thicker. They are by no means 'vastly different sized guys'.  Get the fuck over it and watch the fight for what it is. t1_d0pdl51

Conor has been fighting way under weight. That was a fair fight, both of them went in at their normal weights. That's how fights should be. t1_d0pei24

1
Yeah apparently. Around that. t1_d0pei24
2
> Conor has been fighting way under weight. That was a fair fight, both of them went in at their normal weights. That's how fights should be.

The problem is Conor lost his reach advantage, and that's why he got lit up. In the lower weight divisions he was always had a size advantage. But fuck, I feel bad for him. He took on a challenge he wasn't ready for. 

t1_d0pln8r
1
>He took on a challenge he wasn't ready for.

He was ready for it he just didn't fight smart. He should have fought Nate like Henderson did. He destroyed Nate's front leg and his mobility which made it very hard for Nate to use his boxing. McGregor went toe to toe with the guy and traded punches, that's the worst way to fight the Diaz brothers. t1_d0pei24
3
Basically a Lightweight bout without the unbealthy cutting of weight. And Nate is light for that devision, he doesnt run around at 185 like a few others do.t1_d0pei24
36
I agree. Excessive weight cuts only exist because of the current rules structure. They should measure the fighters weight and body fat percentage at proper hydration and determine the lowest weight they can cut to. They did that in High School Wrestling, I'm sure the UFC can do it. t1_d0prk3w
0
This is prior to the fight. He's a dick pre-fight to sell, after the fight he is all class. At the end of the Aldo fight he gave props to Aldo and said he wished it went a bit longer for his sake. In his interviews after fights he respects his opponents. Same with Nick and Nate. Talent alone won't rake in the numbers so he has to resort to playing an ass.
t1_d0pem2b
2
The easiest way to handle it would be to weigh in like normal on the day before but have another weigh in on the day of fight an hour out where they can't be more than an arbitrary number over, maybe 3 - 5 lbs.t1_d0pem2b
3
Everyone in high school wrestling cheats those tests though. Cutting weight is part of the game. Fighters do it for a reason. Its an advantage.t1_d0pfsa8
1
I didn't...

IDK, at least make it a little hardert1_d0pg13r
1
I did cheat it and it helped. I don't see weight cutting getting dropped anytime soon. Its part of combat sports.t1_d0pem2b
4
You can still cut weight with those tests though. I still cut 25 pounds in high school just by cutting down right before the test, to a few pounds under the weight I wanted to be at and then drinking water up to weight in order to pass the hydration test. Then the test resulted in me being allowed to wrestle at that exact weight and not drop any lower (due to body fat) and I still managed to pass the hydration part. But those tests definitely are a good thing, I'm just saying if high schoolers can get around them pros definitely will.t1_d0pfodb
3
100%, people will always do that stuff, but at least it makes it harder. IDK, I wish there was a way to get everyone to say "Hey, why don't we all just give up weight cutting" but this is a contest people base their livelihoods on. t1_d0pfqsv
2
Yeah I really don't see it leaving anytime soon, wrestlers and boxers have died and I'm pretty sure an MMA fighter died cutting last year. It's just far too embedded in combat sports to just go away. t1_d0pdl51
151
It'll be a 145 defence that's his only option really they won't give him RDA after the number 4 contender just subbed him.t1_d0pef7v
2
And it wasn't just an opportunistic submission either, he straight up traded toe to toe with McGregor and got the best outta him.t1_d0pef7v
12
Agreed- he clearly can't handle 170...
t1_d0pcser
20
Actually, I don't think the hate will be any where near what Rousey got. Conor puts on exciting fights for the fans and took on a monster like Diaz on ten days notice. He then decides to box with him. That's ballsy and cost him dearly. I have respect for what Conor did even though I wanted Diaz to win.t1_d0pfk8s

He absolutely can handle 155. 

He was winning this fight til he got cracked. And that was against the tallest/longest 155er in the top 15 with the best chin in the sport. It's reactionary ninsense to say that being defeated means he would lose to RDA or other lightweights. For all we know most other 155ers wouldn't have bwwn able to eat those shots that nate did.t1_d0phb3u

To be honest, he might have been a tiny bit ahead, but he was by no means winning the fight. It was a close one until he got cracked, and Nate would not have laid down from what Conor showed before he got cracked.t1_d0phdjz

You just said he was ahead and then immediately said the opposite. Which is it? Was he ahead or not?

(Hint: he was)t1_d0phef6
14
Yes he was ahead, but ahead and winning are two different things. There were more than three and a half rounds left, a lot could change (which it did). He wasn't ahead by much either, they were trading blows almost evenly, although Conor got in a few more than Nate.t1_d0phdjz

Actually, I think that's exactly where Connor belongs, somewhere in the top 10 at lightweight. His 145 cuts are too much and unhealthy, but he's talented and if he would have respected Diaz's boxing, he likely could have won a decision victory.t1_d0ph2y3
12
THANK YOU! I can't stand reading about this magical "weight difference" Conor fought against. It was 1 fucking pound! This was not a WW fight, it was a LW fight wuthout a weight cut. People are making more of it than necessary. Diaz is no WW. Conor is a beast and can hang with top 5 to 10 LWs, but as we just saw, top 5ers will give him problems. Conor didn't fight a larger man, he just had his massive size advantage nullified. t1_d0pr4ji

I agree on both counts. I don't think that Conor's punches hurt Diaz like they had hurt others, and Robbie is both larger and tough as a coffin nail.t1_d0pf1pe
1
Yeah, Lawlor would have fucked him up, but it just would have had to be done a different way.

Conor would have a pretty significant speed advantage, and he moves really well, but if (read when) Lawlor touched him cleanly he would be straight out.t1_d0pf5ac

comparing that to playing touch butt on the beach is ridiculous

I get that crossfit's core moves are compound movements that work when done right. However, I feel that the emphasis places on high reps kills it.

Absolutely, but why is it suddenly not an issue when Conor is smaller.

If Conor can make the FW cut he is a FW when he does, if he agrees to let the fight be 170 and Nate makes the cut then that is how it is.

Conor is a huge FW and a small LW.

Diaz is a big LW and a small WW.t1_d0petqh

It works both ways. No question Conor was the smaller man here, and he has big fookin' balls going up against Nate Diaz. He did well all things considering. For me, Conor still has all my respect, he was willing to FIGHT a dangerous opponent and he was all game. Great fight all around, both fighters deserve NOTHING but praise.

2
I mean,  I wouldn't say he got his ass "handed to him".  He was beating up Nate pretty badly before he got hit by that big punch.   Props to Nate though.   You can NEVER count out the Diaz brothers   t1_d0pdfps
13
Badly? Lollllll. Nate was never in trouble. Sure he was getting tagged but he was never in trouble. McGregor was almost out on his feet if he didn't shoot for a takedown. 


t1_d0pdm1u

Honestly, I think it just looked a lot worse than it was in the first round because of how easily Nate gets cut. t1_d0pdtek

And Nate rolls with punches so well that it looks like he's eating a lot of shots but he's deflecting the power. Though he does have a good chin too t1_d0pdbjy
18
No. He had a good fight and got rocked and beat. It's on the 145 and 155ers to beat him now. He's a top quality fighter, as is Nate Diaz, and someone has to win.t1_d0pderh

There's a good chance RDA can beat McGregor, especially considering the ground is his weakness as seen in this fight. But for new MMA fans, the Ronda vs Holms, Holms vs Tate should suffice as showing MMA math won't work. t1_d0pdbjy
31
Yes. Conor tagged Nate repeatedly with punches that rock and/or knock out fighters at 145. Nate got busted up by them, but not enough to lose. Not enough to stagger.

Nate won this fight standing up. Conor tried to escape on the ground, and Nate ended it.

For the record, I am speaking as someone who expected Conor to win. All praise to Diaz.t1_d0pdsqx
2
I think the thing a lot of people were forgetting is that Nate almost always ends up busted up. I think he's just got a fuck load of scar tissue or something because it seems like he always bleeds.

The blood might have left mcgregor thinking he was doing more damage than he was. I don't think he was used to or expecting someone to be able to trade with him power wise.

At least he fought ten day diaz instead of full camp rda.t1_d0pcsmy

He can also take a punch. Conor was lighting him up. I said it before, moving up to 170 was a big mistake for someone who never fought at this level even at 155. t1_d0pdakh

He didn't really move up to 170 though.  He got beat by a 155er who just didn't have to go through the formality of cutting weight.t1_d0pdi05
0
Still, Conor took a fight at a weight he's never fought in, against someone who has had a decade of fighting at 155 at the highest level possible. 

It was a terrible move to fight at 170. There was absolutely nothing to gain from this fight. He must now defend his 145 belt or vacate it. t1_d0pgjwi

We learned that a while back from Sonnen...t1_d0pdkgk

Except Conor is a natural 155 that almost kills himself to get to 145t1_d0pdlgg

He looks drained and sick weighing in at 145t1_d0pdlgg
1
Even if he is a natural 155, he's still fighting out of his element. Frankie Edgar is a natural 155 who was consistently out sized by expert weight cutters. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not making an excuse for Conor loss, I'm just pointing out how it was a terrible decision to fight at 170. 

Gotta give props to McGregor for having the balls to take this risk though.t1_d0pdpnc
5
it was 2 guys that both are 155ers saying they didn't want to cut. not a 145er saying he wants to fight a 170er that will walk into the cage 190 t1_d0pdxey
0
First of all, Diaz didn't want to cut to 155, he didn't want to cut to 160, Conor basically agreed to fight Diaz at the weight Diaz wanted. So the idea that it was both guys not wanting to cut is false. t1_d0pdlgg

This fight has made me a sports fan for the first time in my life. I don't really watch UFC but I watched last week's Anderson/Bisping fight and now this one. I was very aware of all the hype around Connor Mcgregor and that made me think Nate wasn't gonna stand a chance. When Connor started looking dizzy, my heart started racing and when he tapped out, I screamed so hard with excitement that I woke up everybody in the house. t1_d0pdong

Awesome! MMA has become my favorite sport. My heart raced during the Tate and Nate's finishes and I had make sure I didn't get too loud, wife would be pissed. She hates MMA lolt1_d0pdong

It also makes you wanna get in shape. It may just be me, but I think we see all these athletes so often all over our TVs and magazines and stuff that we don't really appreciate the time it takes for them to become the specimens they are. That shit takes so much blood sweat and tears to achieve, constant discipline and dedication. It's admirable as fuck. t1_d0peupj

He's a Diaz brother. They don't get beat. Nate's record is 20-10 and he'll probably tell you he never lost a fight. Nick's the same way. He's "won" every fight. He only lost because of mma rules favoring wrestlers...or whatevert1_d0pdpoy

1
Most of Conors fans will turn on him once he loses the belt since he became the 'big thing' and people are front runners. However, the Diaz brothers have been really big in the bjj community so even if he loses and such they will always have the bjj fans as well as a lot of the others that like him for just being honest and doing their thing without bragging about money or such.  




Plus with Nick's suspension there are so many people that feel bad for them for the stupid suspension for smoking weed that they want them to succeed.  t1_d0pwx93
1
Why did Dana ask him then? Before the know it alls downvote, I'm  genuinely curious.t1_d0pdpoy
2
Exactly. MMA fans are fickle as fuck. A few comments down some lad described Conor as "a smooth talker with slightly above average skill" and got 10 upvotes... I don't even know where to start responding to that. Also expect to see most, if not all, of the most obnoxious McGregor nuthuggers become the loudest McGregor haters and talk about how they always knew he was a bum.t1_d0pdpoy
1
The main thing is that opinion is divided on all fighters. When they do well, their plaudits get upvoted. When they fail, a bunch of losers who can't wait to shit on a human being for having the courage to live this life come out in droves to hate on them. 

So far people are being much easier on McGregor than they were Rousey. Maybe because this was at a different weight class, maybe because Conor and Ronda talk different brands of shit, maybe because the hype hadn't reached critical mass. Who knows.t1_d0pdpoy
12
He deserves that confidence because people thought Connor was untouchable and is probably the biggest star the UFC has ever seen.  Goes to show that if you are a smooth talker with slightly above average skill you can get to really high placest1_d0pdtn1

13
The Diaz brothers are fan favorites, especially among hardcore fans.  There is no front, no act, no filter with them.  What you see is what you get, in all of its glorious insanity.  Some people love them.   Some people can't stand them.  But regardless of what anyone thinks about them personally, it's impossible not to respect them as fighters.  They aren't the best in the world, but they are consistently around the top 5, and a tough out even for the few that can beat them. 

They have a fight style that is very unique to the 2 of them.  Constant little jabs and pitter patter shots that seem slow as molasses, but yet they keep landing.  Many opponents have fallen in the trap.  Opponents basically ignore the shots that are landing on them because they don't hurt that bad and they keep thinking they'll land a countershot ko.  But they can never seem to land the counter clean and the multitude of light punches starts accumulating damage on their face.   They start to get disoriented and can't even get their counter shots off anymore.   Then the Diaz bros start mixing in harder punches.  No haymakers, but every 4th or 5th punch has some crack to it all of a sudden.  Then you either shoot a desperation takedown and get submitted, or you get totally swarmed with punches until you are a bloody heap on the mat. 

To beat the the Diaz brothers, you usually have to be an amazing wrestler with great positional control and submission defense.  You basically have to be strong enough to overpower them.  They are great on the feet.  Great on the ground.  But they just don't have the physical build to be good wrestlers.   The only other path to victory, is to be a great striker with excellent footwork that maintains distance and outpoints them or lands a gigantic shot to knock them out.  Very few have the combined skill and athletic ability to do either. t1_d0pdpoy
34
Diaz brothers' fans won't turn on them because they keep it real. There's no filter, no BS, no public persona with them. Nate has talked confidently before and lost afterwards, yet his following and credibility keeps growing.t1_d0pe6t2
4
Wolf tickets don't sell the deal. t1_d0pe6t2
10
Exactly. They are what they say they are. Kill or be killed. You watch a Diaz fight, you're gonna see some shit go down. They each have a certain will about them, they put it all out there every time. Nate said it best. One of us will one, one of us will lose, that's it. Simple, fuck the flash, shut up, get in the cage, and let's fucking go. Also two dudes who routinely get super blazed and do marathons and triathlons and shit are some damn good motivation. t1_d0pggz4
9
The Diaz brothers' lifestyle is something a lot of people everyhwere can relate to. Fans of fighters who act larger than life like McGregor are people who want to see a show. Diaz brothers' fans want to see and support a real story of struggle unfold with dignity. Both type of fans are legitimate, but they're definitely two different ways of following sports.t1_d0pmwyy

No doubt about that. They may have a lot of fans who identify with them outside the octagon, but their fights alone are something to behold for any MMA fan.t3_4965yf

It's never helpful bringing casual fans in to have a revolving door.  Best case for UFC is that Rousey comes back and beats Tate once again then defends against Holm.t1_d0pcsx5
6
Dana was probably happy with Holm losing. Holm's fights in the UFC have all been boring. She's an absolutly boring fighter and needs to be carried by the opponent to make it interesting. If the opponent sits there and doesnt pressure the action: you get rounds 1 3 4 where nothing really happens.

Sure, the Rousey fight was great, Rousey pressured the action nonstop right into Holm's plan..t1_d0pew3p
-11
That fight was booooooooring. Even if Holmes can beat Rousey again (I doubt it), hype and $ is important, I am excited to watch a Rousey fight, I am not excited to watch a Holmes snooze-fest, I don't care how supposedly technically superior she is.t1_d0pcsx5

ronda wasnt coming back to fight holm but she'll come back to beat tate a third time, collect her belt and (probably) retire.

its a very sellable fight that appeals even to casuals.
twas the best outcome for him financially for tate to win.t1_d0pcsx5
7
I imagine Dana will be just fine, especially if GSP comes back to fight Lawler at UFC200. I mean, it's not like people aren't going to buy a card that features that, plus Conor-Frankie, and either Tate-Holm 2 or Tate-Rousey 3.

The only real loser tonight is RDA, who probably never gets his Red Panty Night payday now.t1_d0peaw1

People don't get it though.  He could have been coming back to fight an on top Conor. That easily would have been the biggest UFC fight ever.  Conor wont be around at 170 now, at least not on top.t1_d0pl0fa
1
Why would anyone - except maybe Conor himself - think he should be taking fights at 170? Especially when there are still money fights at 145 and 155.t1_d0ppbnp
1
Obviously he was a little over ambitious to try but take a look at the list of biggest ppv buys and you'll notice how almost all the fights are 170 and above  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view t1_d0ps9fg
1
I'm not sure what your point is. Conor has the 2nd highest grossing ppv ever despite fighting at only145 lbs, and GSP is the UFC's biggest ppv draw ever with the exception of perhaps only Brock Lesnar; and it's very possible that they're both going to be on the card of UFC 200 (and maybe Rousey too). And again, they're two weight classes apart; saying that Conor and/or GSP are losing out because they won't ever fight each other now is like saying Anderson Silva missed out by not getting a chance to fight Brock Lesnar back in the day. t1_d0pspkf
1
What's the next blockbuster fight for Conor?  Whatever it is, it probably won't even be as big as this fight, let alone a St Pierre, Lawlor, Hendricks, or even McDonald or Condit. Bottom line is that there are more options at welterweight.  They aren't stupid, that's why he was trying to make the jump.t1_d0pemql

> the hype decides the matchmaking

Yep. It's all about who will sell the most wolf tickets.t1_d0pswdf
1
UFC 200, probably vs Edgar, on a card that - if the rumors are true - will likely have 3 of the UFC's 4 biggest ppv draws ever fighting on it. When he wins vs a fighter that's not two weight divisions above him, the hype train starts up again. The only thing last night's loss did is force him to fight Edgar and probably rematch Aldo before moving up to 155 lbs. 

And honestly, all of those fights you mentioned at 170 are terrible ideas. Robby Lawler or Johny Henricks might have straight up hospitalized Conor. They're just too big, and Conor doesn't have enough of a skill advantage anywhere in his game to negate the size. All other things being equal, the big man will beat the little man pretty much every single time regardless of the names involved. I mean, for example, sure GSP vs Jon Jones would do 2 million ppv buys also, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea long term for anyone involved.

Like I said above, the only real loser in all of this is RDA who realistically might not be champion when Conor fights for the 155 belt and possibly never sees the Red Panty Night payday now.t1_d0pt89f
1
Like I said, now it's obvious that his future isn't at welterweight but he was twice the size of Nate at 170. If he had won last night everyone would be clamoring to fight the other big boys in the division.  t1_d0pcsx5

Really? I mean going into the fight, I believe it was pretty close. After the first round I felt Conor was gonna handle it (like Vegas, majority of MMA pundits, and my group of ass-hole friends at the bar believed). But that second round he looked gassed and Nate seized the opportunity.

When you, as an adult with free will, type "Well...I ain't surprised MOTHER FUCKER!!!" it leads me to believe that you have been waiting months to type this message. It leads me to believe that after Conor KO'd Jose, you went into your garage and screamed into a pillow so that your friends/family wouldn't hear you and you promised that once he finally got stopped that you would undercut the first person you saw on Reddit that expressed general confusion at his loss. 

Nate Diaz is raw and a force at 170. Anyone who doubts that is delusional. But think for one moment: Conor is 2 weight classes above where he has been fighting for his past fights. How lucky are we that we saw them fight at all? 

I may be still tipsy from the fight and I may have been rooting for Conor, but I will be damned if I let some half assed/fanboy comment get by in this subreddit!

That's the point - they were lining up, but Aldo was offered this fight and turned it down.

Saying 'you got nowhere to run' after he just refused a fight just makes Aldo look silly.t1_d0pcxqf

I think he defends from frankie and if there's anything positive I take away from this is... Holy fuck frankie WILL NOT be able to stand with conor. Even nate was clearly pretty hurt at the end of round 1. And that was no weight cut, probably 175 pound nate. And he's kind of known for his absurd chin to begin with.t1_d0pcwg7

Nate is a 155er anyway.   He just didn't cut weight.  Nate's fought at 170 before and did well until he started running up against great grapplers that could totally overpower him and had great sub defense.   Connor's even smaller than Nate and doesn't have a quarter of his ground skills.  He has no business at 170, ever.  He's gonna get overpowered by top grapplers at 155 too.  I think he's gonna have problems with Frankie Edgar at his own weight class. 

Connor is a good fighter.  He is not the Irish reincarnation of Bruce Lee.  There is no magic.  He is eminently beatable by any top tier fighter at his weight or above.  He is skilled and can win against top guys as well.   But this is the most overinflated hype train in the history of the sport.  It had to pop. 

I asked around this week looking for a bookie to place a bet on Diaz. Unfortunately I didn't find one in time.  I'm not much of a gambler.  But when I saw Nate at +380, it would be stupid not to jump on that.  The fans had created the equivalent of anoverinflated market bubble.  When I first got into mma 10 years ago, I used to see odds all the time that I knew were way off.  Unfortunately back then I didn't have the income to bet.  By the time I had a good enough income to do some betting, the bookmakers and fans had a better handle on the sport and I didn't really see odds that were out of bounds anymore.   Then came Connor McGregor.  When I saw Nate as nearly a 4 to 1 underdog my eyes popped.  I thought even with the big Connor following, Nate should have opened as only a slight underdog and even then only because Connor fans are crazy. 

I hope the fans write this loss off as being because it was at 170 and keep skewing the betting lines.   I look forward to making money off suckers. t1_d0pcwg7

Maybe he could get lucky and catch RDA, but more then half the top ten at lw would murder him. He killed himself cutting to 145 for a reason: to duck all that competition.t1_d0pcwg7

Let's be real here, this matchup was 2 LW's that didn't have to cut weight.  Conor would be a #5-10 LW.t1_d0pczxb

From the moment it was announced Diaz was gonna fight him at that weight I kept thinking that Diaz was gonna pull it off.  All week Connor was off his game and you can tell Diaz got in his head, Connor forgot that fake crazy (him) is nothing like real crazy (Diaz) and lost the shit talk/mind games.

Connor, like Tyson, beats most of his opponents before the fights even begins by fucking with their head. You could see multiple times in the fight where Connor was thrown off his game and Diaz proved Connor a one trick pony who uses smoke and mirrors and has no ground game like Lauzon said.t1_d0pdb9e

It was scored 10-8 multiple rounds by multiple judges. An absolute mauling to the point you actually winced every time the leg got kicked. I don't know if UFC brass would have seen enough in that fight to think Nate warrants a rematch. It really was that one-sided.t1_d0pcre5

McGregor did go up two weight classes from his chosen division.  True he'd planned to go up one, but when Diaz couldn't do 155,he had to go to 170.  That's two weight classes. t1_d0pdcni

It is his wallet that should save him.  He is no longer invincible.  He can no longer talk endless amounts of trash about the 155's.  Nate fights at 155, if he actually fought someone who fights at 170, he would get straight merc'ed.t1_d0pd0dk

Diaz is a legit 155'er and Conor pulled and Anderson Silva and did not take him serious.  If there is a next time at 155, he is not going to mock his opponent.  I am saying McGregor has a chance at 155.  If he fought a Lawler, he would get pummeled.t1_d0pdfny

Eating two breakfasts a day trying to get to 170 killed his endurance. Diaz is definitely much superior at bjj and it showed. Let's be honest though, Conor had to put on weight to get to the 170 lb mark and still came in under. Diaz walks around over 170. Diaz definitely outclassed Conor in this fight with or without the excuses. But packing on 20lbs in a few months and trying to fight and not lose endurance is impossible. t1_d0qijn0

Dont see how Nate beats rda tbh. Southpaw leg kickers are already his worst nightmare, when you add wrestling and excellent top control it just looks really hard for him. 

Rda even won the slapping contest when they fought haha.

But yea, lawler vs nate is insane, wouldnt surprise me if they scheduled it tho, cashing in on Nate's win over Conor i guess.t1_d0pd27b

Why isn't Nate champion level?  It's pretty clear to me that his fight against RDA was a real eye opener and that he went back to the training board and really started to work hard.

Hell he checked kicks in the Michael Johnson fight.  A Diaz brother checking kicks is definitely championship level.
You are underestimating a Diaz brother.  Conor Mcgregor just made the same mistake.

Yeah, and to think he wanted to fight Lawler. HAH t1_d0pddr3

I'm not getting you. 

Are you saying that Nate Diaz doesn't usually fight 155?  He does. 

Are you saying that Conor McGregor doesn't usually fight 145?  He does. 

Are you saying that fighting at 170 isn't going up two weight classes? It is. Unequivocally. 

Or are you saying that the match between  Conor and Nate wasn't a contest at 170? Because it was. Dana made a big deal that his poster boy was willing to take on a fight going up two weight classes. 

You aren't making sense. t1_d0pddr3

Man imagine him playing this "stand in front of him game" (after all the talk about how Aldo and Mendes were just standing in front of each other zzz) with Lawler.... he had no idea how much size matters did he... maybe he is just crazy.. or maybe he just drank the same kool aid that 1/3rd of his fans swallowed.t1_d0pcvog

2
One fight and the circle jerk goes from "Conor could take the 170 belt" to "He can't even beat the top 10 in 170"

Conor lost fair and square. That is true. But he still had the upper hand in this fight. He underestimated the power of Welterweight and you can see this by the fact that he hardly had his hands up. He treated the fight as a joke and deserved his loss.

Conor did some serious damage in that first round without going 100% and underestimating his opponent. If he genuinely tries his hardest and doesn't let his ego take over, he could definitely win fights against the WW top 10.t1_d0pexcn

At no point in this fight did he have the upper hand. He was landing flush and not backing Diaz up at all. You could say he was up on points after the first round but everyone knew he was in big trouble.  Also where did you get this theory that he had his hands low because he underestimated the power of welterweights? Far more likely is that is just his style and wont change regardless the weight he fights at.
The story of the night is Conor lost to an average 170er in Nate Diaz, who didn't train for the fight, and who has been nothing more than a stepping stone for the last five years. And it's not like Diaz is naturally bigger than Conor, they both walk around at 170. Fact is Conor was exposed in this fight. There are serious doubts if he can even beat clay guida.t1_d0pis82

Conor was out striking Diaz pretty good in the first round though. He made impressive dodges and landed some good hits. He was advancing way more than Nate and had ring control UNTIL Nate caught him with his guard down. That's when the fight changed.t1_d0pqb7w

> UNTIL Nate caught him with his guard down. That's when the fight changed.

If by "caught him with his guard down" you mean landed clean shots in normal exchanges. Conor wasn't taking a smoke break; they were both doing their usual stuff.t1_d0q09fx

I'm not saying Nate didn't land a good hit. Nate 100% deserved this win. I just don't get why people act like Conor was losing from the moment he stepped into the octagon.t1_d0q14gw

I completely agree with you there. Conor won that first round handily.t1_d0ppsvr
10
Forced? Look at Conor's body. It does look absolutely natural. Because this is his natural weight class and he was just keeping his weight down to have the height and reach advantage.  
And now we see what he is without that and getting into someone's head. Just another fighter.t1_d0pis82

Nah he should go work his way through lightweight imo. 170 a roster of monsters even Nate had trouble when he fought there. t1_d0pd3b3
1
This I agree with hands down. 155 seems closer to his natural weight, and this fight humbled him so I don't think he'll go chasing RDA once again. I do want Frankie to get his chance at 145 thought1_d0pd66j

Nate is a 155er and not even considered a championship contender at 155 so how is Conor going to challenge?t1_d0pdbc3
-4
Fight was at 170 - Conor clowned and got rocked. 

If this fight was at 155, maybe Conor doesn't get as gassed from the extra weight; let's not forget to mention he won the first round. He got caught and wobbled because he was clowning. 

Conor could absolutely challenge in 155, he just needs to actually earn it this time. t1_d0pdbc3

Nate is absolutely a championship contender now. Even before this fight he would be in consideration for the next title fight if RDA were to lose whether to connor or somebody elset1_d0pcvog

All he has to do is be more careful next time he picks his opponent. There are plenty LW who would have trouble with Conor. Diaz was his worst match up, but Conor got too cocky.t1_d0pcyi5
2
I love everything Joe was saying about weight cuts during the walk-ins, but in the UFC's current state it's hard to win consistently at the highest level of your natural weight. t1_d0pcyi5
149
He's just too small for that weight division thingy imo. It's taller guys with longer reach, so the slipping and fighting still he's used to doing won't work as well. He's a counter fighter and when he has to close the distance to fight, it's bad for him

I know this is going to sound controversial, but I think Conor takes this match more than Nate takes it.  
He was having success landing his shots and breaching Nate's defence.  
  
Although there's the flaw in my argument that Nate was on 11 day notice so his reflexes and timing may have not been on point.t1_d0pdg1e
1
This is a winnable fight for McGregor. He has the speed advantage and is a much more diverse striker. He just got sucked into Diaz' game and was headhunting instead of following the blueprint that has been laid out to beat the Diaz bros. Leg kick and keep distance. Don't stay at their range. If Connor fought more like condit against nick he would have coasted to a decision (thank god he didn't because that was boring as shit). He did not fight smart at all here and was going for the big KO against a guy who is not going down unless you simply land the perfect strike on the button. The weight had nothing to do with it. They were probably within 5 lbs of each other. t1_d0pdg1e
4
What lol. Conor had a full training camp against 10 days no studying or real preparation like Diaz. Yeah he was a bigger fighter but I don't think the things that made nate win would change at all in McGregors favor

-nates reach and size
-nates chin
-nates ground game 
-nate can stand with him fine 
And then
-diaz has a full camp, knows conors style and what to expect
-Conor was prepared for a fight, sure it was different but he got what he wanted, someone to stand with him
-nate is a 155 naturally, sure nates weight will be different but nates only difference will be a little less weight but more prepared, idk if McGregor will find success at 155 but he certainly could but I don't think he dominates , and if not he will starve himself at 145 for a long time 
So how he Conor beat him? t1_d0pdg1e

Yeah they said he was in shape because he was training for a triathalon but thats a different type of in shape with less coordination (i think fuck if i know how a triathalon works)t1_d0pdi5m

I mean triathlon is just pure steady state cardio so I dunno either how it impacts the fight lol.  
  
But yea I am just emotional thrown away, this night was somethingt1_d0pd087
1
That's what I was saying when Joe was saying at the beginning of the fright about how that's how they should be no weight cuts. It just won't work like that. You'll have guys being way too small and lose reach and height. t1_d0pdjqn
2
guys who are small with no reach or height could walk around at a lower weight then couldn't they?t1_d0pd087

When you're truly elite, you can pull multiple weight classes off. Conor is just not elite.

In boxing, Mayweather went through 5 divisions, 24 pounds and still made everyone look foolish while never dehydrating. Pacquiao went through even more divisions and was still making much bigger man think twice about trading with him. The problem in MMA is the truly elite fighters don't even try to move up, because there is little incentive and a lot of risk.

Edit: I'll elaborate on that a bit, in boxing sticking to one division does not capture the public's imagination because a lot of fighters in the past have gone up and cleared out many divisions. To capture public interest and go somewhat mainstream you need to accomplish that, sticking to one division won't cut it. In MMA it hasnt been done yet and it's not EXPECTED, elite fighters will be marketed by the UFC even if they stick to one division and make good money. If they accept to go up a weight class, most of them won't get more $ in the first fight or two(because they can't market themselves like Conor) and risk losing and diminishing their value before seeing profit from the endeavor. t1_d0q0up0

Weak are those who are dependent on some Führer to hug his nuts.t1_d0pem0e
3
I agree to an extent, but you have to factor in how hard grappling against a bigger and stronger opponent is compared to just striking. imo grappling is more taxing on your cardio and it's harder to make up the strength difference with skill if the the guy has some level of training.

t1_d0pewq9
3
There's no doubt grappling is harder physically than standing up against a bigger man, I wouldnt expect MMA fighters to clear 3-4 divisions, ever. But going up 10 pounds even with the ground fighting and grappling is in no way as much of a problem as going up 25 pounds standing like elite boxers do. People start walking right through your punches. The wieght difference between 185 and 205 might be too much to move up also, the guys at 205 look really huge.

You pretty much saw it tonight, there wasnt much grappling and the fight lasted 9 minutes mostly standing... The bigger guy starts walking through your shots so you better have something else than power and accuracy and you better be able to take a big man's punch or not get hit, obviously.

t1_d0pd087
3
Can you imagine him fighting a 6'3" Condit? It would be embarassing. t1_d0pd087
3
Not really. He's probably big enough or at least could be if he added a few pounds of mass, his frame certainly is big enough. But his athleticism won't be enough to defend take downs and bjj without the size advantage, and there are killers at ww. He couldn't even keep mendes on a weeks notice from pinning him to the mat. He needs to evolve and learn some new skills.t1_d0pd087

Good points. Conor looking like a zombie for the 145 cut is for a reason. Joe Rogan kind of ate his words a bit with the comments before the fight. Although I kind of agree with Joe and support him daily. JRE all day.t1_d0pd087

You remember the last time a smaller man made fun of Rory in the buildup? BJ Penn? Rory was KILLING him but didn't finish it, and in one of his post-fight interviews he explained that because of BJ's trash talk, he kept the fight going just to hit him some more... McGregor v McDonald sounds to me like... I dunno, a can crushing a can, then uncrushing just to crush it again repeatedly.t1_d0pcre5

Going to be hard selling that 145 title fight after Nate called them midgets then slapped McGregor around. t1_d0pcx0x
1
Nah. Most people understand that bigger guys usually beat up smaller guys. Connor took a fight for fun against a much larger opponent on short notice and got out-BJJ'd by a double black belt. I don't think most fight fans will look at that and think he now somehow sucks. I'm still excited to see him up against RDA. Jumping up or down ten pounds is reasonable, but 25 is too much for anyone to reasonably throw on and then fight a world class fight.t1_d0pcx0x

I don't think he "slapped McGregor around."t1_d0pcx0x

You call that slapping McGregor around? what fight did you watch? Selling a McGregor fight is just about the easiest thing in the world, despite tonight. t1_d0pd797

Not to mention it wasn't one sided.t1_d0pda3x
1
Yeah Mcgregor won the first round. Though Nate took a lot of left hand shots and although it done visible damage he wasn't shaken. I wonder if Conor is only powerful at 145 because of the size advantage or if Nate's chin made it look weaker.t1_d0pditq
2
Another part of it now is: Can McGregor take shots from the heavier class? It really didn't take too many big shots to wobble him. Diaz definitely has a better jaw than most, but can McGregor handle those shots himself? Can he even win on the ground against bigger dudes? This fight seemed to show some of his weaknesses if he plans to move up. 

I really love watching him fight, so I hope this was just one bad fight. I'd love to see him win another belt at heavier weight and hear more shit talking. Guess his next fight will be even more important to his career path in UFC.t1_d0pfjgj

It won't be hard to continue to advertise the division itself as one of the most talent-heavy (because it is). 

About McGregor's odyssey to the deep end of the kiddie pool? It can just be reaffirmation of why weight classes are a thing, and why Cain never bothered to chat shit back to Honda Housey.t1_d0pcx0x

I honestly would like to see him back in FW for a while. Defend that belt 3 or 4 times (or atleast attempt too) and then move on too LW and vacate.

He definitely isn't short on chances though. Everyone in any division would love to fight him, if only for the pay day it would entail.t1_d0ph350
2
I think Nate was the best chance he had at 155. Seriously losing to Nate has done more damage to Conor's rep than Dos Anjos. 2 weeks notice and the #5 bashes you around is not a good sign for fighting out of your weight class.t1_d0pjsv1
2
Completely different fighters though.

Diaz did a lot of things really well that made it very difficult for Conor to be Conor. Against RDA he has his reach advantage back, RDA is more susceptible to body work than Diaz is, and I don't think RDA could survive that sort of punishment if Conor hit him that much.

Fights simply don't translate like that. I mean you just have to look at the women's bantamweights.

For what it is worth I would likely pick RDA by submission. But I think Conor would beat Cerrone for example.t1_d0pjwmp

I'd pick cerrone over Conor and I still think RDA beats Conor anywhere he wants. I understand how fight styles work and I'm still saying Nate is the best chance he had at winning at LW.t1_d0pk6xl

Oh damn. I forgot about that whole angle that they have been working. This fight made it obvious (seems obvious to me, but maybe I'm wrong) that McGregor isn't going to be able to handle head shots from the higher weight classes. 

They REALLY needed him to win at least his first fight at the higher weight. That would have given them three fights to sell the "I'm coming for all your belts" storyline. Diaz really f'd up that route...we'll see though.t1_d0pcw99
