We ended up our session with sparring so all of us was really tired. Now to my questions.\n\n1. Against the bigger guy everytime I threw a jab I ate 1 or 2 back which basically made me ignore throwing hands, so I started defending and using pushkicks and lowkicks, these worked much better but I still got my ass kicked, ate probably like 30 shots and gave 3. I really didn't know how to hit his face cause he basically had his arms out in my face cus of his huge reach advantage, what to do?\n \n2. I loved sparring against LW but From a healthy perspective, is it okay to eat alot of jabs from a  HW even if its just light sparring? Or should I totally avoid this at all cost? \n\n3. Against the smaller all went so much easier, more flowy and I could land a few punches, this guy was so defensive and had his guard supertight, so I wondering of any tips how to open his face if you know what I mean, is there any point e.g throwing a cross if he got both hands up tight?\n\n4. Against HW-dude I got so exhausted, I'm so sure I got better cardio than him but yet felt like he drained all my energy with his pressure, is there a correlation that his pressure had me gassed? So basically, the more pressure/shots u land the more energy you're opponent waste?",
