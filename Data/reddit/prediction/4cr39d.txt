If Aldo wins, then I don't think McGregor will be able to beat him again. I'm a McGregor fan but Aldo is a beast. He's not gonna go down again easily. And at UFC 196 we saw how easy McGregor gets tired. And Aldo has the longest average fight time. Aldo can stay in a fight and tire his opponent. Also he does BJJ. Which I think is McGregor's weakness. So if McGregor loses to Diaz and Aldo wins Edgar and Aldo beats McGregor, he'll lose reputation and popularity. I'm not saying that this will happen.

If Aldo wins, then I don't think McGregor will be able to beat him again. I'm a McGregor fan but Aldo is a beast. He's not gonna go down again easily. And at UFC 196 we saw how easy McGregor gets tired. And Aldo has the longest average fight time. Aldo can stay in a fight and tire his opponent. Also he does BJJ. Which I think is McGregor's weakness. So if McGregor loses to Diaz and Aldo wins Edgar and Aldo beats McGregor, he'll lose reputation and popularity. I'm not saying that this will happen. I don't want it to. But if it does,then McGregor will be history. Thanks for reading.",
